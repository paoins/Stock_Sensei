Yahoo Entertainment,Ford says its Q1 profit fell by two-thirds and it expects a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year,,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. says it expects to take a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year and is withdrawing its full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's evolving trade policy.

Ford said Monday that its net income fell by about two-thirds in the first quarter to $473 million, or 12 cents per share, from $1.33 billion, or 33 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue dropped 5% to $40.66 billion.

The results topped the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet, who forecast earnings per share for the quarter would be flat. Revenue was forecast to be $38.02 billion. Still, the stock fell more than 2% in after-hours trading.

Last week, General Motors said it is bracing for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. Ford and Tesla are expected to see a smaller impact from tariffs than GM and other automakers because they assemble more of their cars in the U.S. Still, what impact they do see won't be insignificant.

Ford originally forecast 2025 earnings before interest and taxes in a range of $7 billion to $8.5 billion, but on Monday the company said the risks associated with tariffs “make updating full year guidance challenging right now given the potential range of outcomes.”

Ford CEO Jim Farley has been touting the advantage that higher domestic production gives his company and he did so again Monday, while acknowledging that the shake-up to the industry from tariffs is still in its early stages.

“It’s too early to gauge the related market dynamics, including the potential industrywide supply chain disruptions,” said Farley said on an earnings call with analysts. “Automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage, and, boy, that is that true for Ford. It puts us in the pole position.”

President Donald Trump says one goal of his trade policy is to move more manufacturing of products such as autos back to the U.S. Last week Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in a move the president said would allow automakers more time to transition their manufacturing operations.

Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide.

The potential impact of tariffs dominated Ford's earnings calls, with one executive noting how just a little trouble with a few parts could have a dramatic effect.

“The rare earth materials from China, for example, how they are imported, not just for us, but for the entire industry, has become rather complicated over the last few weeks,” said Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra. “It would take only a few parts to potentially cause some disruption into our production.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-says-q1-profit-fell-223419913.html,
New Zealand Herald,"Tesla’s New Zealand revenue crashed in 2024 – and this year is worse, so far",,"Overall New Zealand new vehicle registrations continued their downward drift last month; from 9223 in April last year to 8839 for the month just gone – a 3.9% drop.

But while the overall market is soft, EV sales have picked up sharply in New Zealand so far this year, in part because of keenly-priced Chinese brands, including the Geely-owned Polestar and BYD.

April sales figures released by the Motor Industry Association (MIA) show 494 battery electric vehicle new registrations for the month, compared with 279 for April 2024 and 2316 year-to-date compared with 1499 at this point last year.

Tesla lags

The comeback is relative. EV sales were still just under half the number recorded in the Clean Car Discount-fuelled April 2023.

And Tesla, which held the number one and number three sales slots around this time last year, has just one model in April’s top five:

Top-selling EVs in New Zealand, April 2025

Tesla has sold 179 of its mainstay Model Y cars in New Zealand so far this year compared with 292 at this point in 2024 (a year that in itself saw the 60% revenue slump outlined above).

Musk pulls back

The firm has faced global protests and seen vandal attacks – including in Auckland – in the wake of Musk donating more than US$250m ($418m) to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign then spearheading the returning President’s Doge cost-cutting drive.

Another factor was some customers waiting for the refreshed 2025 version of the Model Y. First deliveries had been expected in April. Tesla ANZ has been approached for comment. The automaker is still offering run-out Model Ys at a $10,000 discount on its New Zealand website in a promotion that began in January.

The BYD Shark 6 PHEV,

On Tesla‘s first-quarter conference call on April 22, after his firm reported a 71% fall in net profit to US$409m (after booking US$595m from other automakers who pay Tesla for carbon credits to offset their sale of conventional vehicles), Musk said he would spend less time on Doge and more at Tesla from the end of May.

Tesla shares rallied after Musk announced his pending pullback from Trump and were recently trading at US$280.26. The stock hit an all-time high of US$479.86 in December as the new President prepared to take power.

Recently, a rift has opened up between Musk and Trump over tariffs. Musk, whose firm imports batteries from BYD in China, among other offshore-manufactured parts, opposes the measure.

Shark chomps, Cybertruck absent

Tesla had a Cybertruck on tour here earlier this year, but has yet to say when the electric ute will be available for New Zealand customers.

Meanwhile, BYD’s plug-in hybrid dual-cab ute, the Shark 6, continues to be a runaway hit for the Chinese firm, with 119 sales in April 658 year to date – making it one of New Zealand’s top-selling light commercial vehicles (the year-to-date chart-toppers are the Toyota Hilux on 2528 and the Ford Ranger on 2460).

Tesla builds at Westgate

Tesla, which closed its showroom and service centreon central Auckland’s Karangahape Rd in May last year, will soon open a new facility at Westgate in the city’s northwest, which will be called “Tesla North”.

In July 2023, Telsa opened a large showroom, service centre and spare parts facility in Māngere, dubbed “Tesla South”, near Auckland Airport.

Tesla New Zealand’s rent expenses increased to $2.1m in 2024 from $826,000 in 2023.

Tesla has been asked for comment.

The Star Online,Tesla sales slump in Europe,,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Tesla sales in Europe plunged in the first four months of the year by 37.2 percent, even as sales of fully electric vehicles in Europe rose 28 percent, according to a Reuters report on Monday.

Tesla sales in Sweden dropped 81 percent to its lowest level in nearly three years, according to the report.

Tesla's new car sales in Spain fell 36 percent in April to just 571 vehicles year over year, according to data from industry group ANFAC (Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers).

Tesla's poor sales outcome in Europe come as some buyers protest CEO Elon Musk's closeness with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose tariffs have resulted in global economic instability.

Electrek,Tesla Cybertruck inventory skyrockets to record high,,"Tesla’s Cybertruck inventory has skyrocketed to a new record high of more than 10,000 units. The vehicle program is in crisis.

We reported at the beginning of April that Tesla ended the first quarter of 2025 with at least 2,400 Cybertrucks in new inventory available in the US.

There’s no exact way to track Tesla’s inventory in the US, but there are ways to track Tesla’s Cybertruck listings. Sometimes, Tesla may have many vehicles with the exact same configuration at the same location and it will only publish a single listing for it.

Therefore, Tesla might have been sitting on more Cybertruck inventory.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

A month later, the number of listings in the US has skyrocketed to over 10,000 Cybertrucks, according to Tesla-Info.com:

This surge could be due to an actual net increase in Cybertruck inventory, but Tesla is also heavily discounting the trucks at varying rates, creating several different prices and, therefore, more listings.

At an average sale price of $78,000, Tesla could have almost $800 million worth of Cybertrucks.

Due to low demand, Tesla appears to have significantly slowed down Cybertruck production in recent months. Therefore, this surge is likely more about Tesla discounting the vehicles, exposing the broader US inventory, than an actual major increase in inventory due to more production.

Many of the Cybertrucks in inventory were built in 2024, so they are already at least four months old. Tesla still has ‘Foundation Series’ Cybertrucks in inventory, which it stopped producing in October 2024—more than seven months ago.

Tesla recently launched the Cybertruck RWD, but it has given up on making it with a smaller battery pack and instead removed many important features.

Electrek’s Take

This is about as bad as it gets. Over 10,000 units account for about two quarters of Tesla’s Cybertruck sales.

It already looks like Tesla has slowed Cybertruck production down to a crawl, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it pauses it soon. The hard part for Tesla is to admit defeat.

The Cybertruck RWD using the same battery pack as the AWD was already a sort of admission that Tesla found the vehicle program to be too small to be worth being produced with two battery pack sizes. The automaker did the same with Model S/X when the program’s volumes shrank following the launches of Model 3 and Model Y.

It looks like under the current circumstances, Tesla will have issues selling more than 20,000 Cybertrucks per year in the US despite having planned production for 250,000 units.",http://electrek.co/2025/05/05/tesla-cybertruck-inventory-skyrockets-to-record-high/,2025-05-05 00:00:00
Japan Today,OpenAI reverses course and says its nonprofit will continue to control its business,,"By MATT O'BRIEN

OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the business that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.

“We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,” said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.

Altman and the chair of OpenAI’s nonprofit board, Bret Taylor, said the board made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI. The nonprofit already has a for-profit arm, but that arm will be converted into a public benefit corporation “that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission,” Taylor said.

OpenAI’s co-founders, including Altman and Tesla CEO Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity’s benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.

OpenAI faced a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led Musk to invest in the charity.

OregonLive,Maker of ChatGPT says it will remain under nonprofit control after all,,"After months spent pursuing a plan to convert itself into a for-profit business, OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the company that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.

“We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,” said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.

Altman and the chair of OpenAI’s nonprofit board, Bret Taylor, said the board made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI. The nonprofit already has a for-profit arm, but that arm will be converted into a public benefit corporation “that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission,” Taylor said.

However, Taylor declined to say Monday how large of an ownership stake the nonprofit will have in the new public benefit corporation. He said in a call with reporters that the nonprofit will choose the board members of the public benefit corporation and, at first, they will likely be the same people who now sit on OpenAI’s nonprofit board.

Public benefit corporations were first created in Delaware in 2013 and other states have adopted the same or similar laws that require the companies to pursue not just profit but a social good. Public benefit corporations, which include Amalgamated Bank and the online education platform Coursera, need to define that social good, which can vary broadly, when they incorporate.

Altman said that converting from a limited liability company to a public benefit corporation “just sets up us to be a more understandable structure to do the things that a company of our scope has to do.”

Among the changes would be removing a cap OpenAI had placed on how much profit it could make.

“There’s so much more demand to use AI tools than we thought there was going to be,” Altman said. Getting access to more capital will make it easier for OpenAI to pursue mergers and acquisitions “and other normal things companies would do,” Altman said.

OpenAI’s co-founders, including Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity’s benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.

OpenAI first outlined plans last year to convert its core governance structure but faced a number of challenges. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led Musk to invest in the charity. A federal judge last week dismissed some of Musk’s claims and allowed others to proceed to a trial set for next year.

OpenAI also faced scrutiny from the top law enforcement officers in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, and California, where it operates out of a San Francisco headquarters. The California attorney general’s office said in a statement that it was reviewing the plan and, “This remains an ongoing matter — and we are in continued conversations with Open AI.”

The attorney general’s office in Delaware did not immediately return a request for comment.

A number of advocates, including former OpenAI employees and other charities, had petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI’s charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring.

Some were concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harm.

Multiple other artificial intelligence companies have opted to incorporate as public benefit corporations, including Anthropic and xAI, Musk’s company. However, OpenAI would remain unique in that its public benefit corporation would still be controlled by the nonprofit’s board.

Altman said it would “maybe be easier” to raise money if OpenAI were a “fully normal company,” but given its mission, “we don’t want to be a fully normal company, and we believe this is well over the bar of what we need to be able to fundraise.”

“We’ve had plenty of investors who think OpenAI is a great business but don’t care about or don’t appreciate our mission,” Altman said, adding that he was “happy not to have their money.”

Altman said he still expects a large investment from Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group, which in February announced plans to set up a joint company with OpenAI to push AI services.

The company’s biggest investor over the past several years has been Microsoft, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Electrek,"Ford warns Trump’s tariffs will cost $2.5 billion, withdraws 2025 guidance",,"Ford (F) reported its first-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street’s revenue and EPS expectations. However, with Trump’s auto tariffs, Ford is suspending full-year guidance. Here’s a breakdown of Ford’s Q1 2025 earnings

Ford Q1 2025 earnings preview

After crosstown rival General Motors cut its full-year financial guidance last week, investors are waiting to see if Ford will follow suit.

Ford’s previous 2025 forecast called for EBIT of $7 billion to $8.5 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion.

The biggest threat is Trump’s new auto tariffs, which include a 25% duty on imported vehicles and many parts. Since Ford builds a greater percentage of vehicles in the US than any other major automaker, outside of Tesla, it isn’t expected to see as big of an impact.

CEO Jim Farley called it “an opportunity for Ford,” during an interview with CNN last week, saying the company has a “different footprint, a different exposure for tariffs.”

Ford imports around 21% of the vehicles it sells in the US, while GM imports around 46%. According to Estimize, Wall St expects Ford to post Q1 EPS of $0.0 on revenue of $38.02 billion.

The company reports earnings for each of its three business units, Ford Blue (gas-powered vehicles), Model e (electric vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial and software business).

In the fourth quarter, Ford’s EV unit (Model e) lost another $1.4 billion while Pro and Blue each reported an adjusted EBIT of $1.6 billion.

Financial breakdown

Ford beat Wall Street estimates, reporting first-quarter revenue of $40.7 billion with an adjusted EPS of 0.49.

Q1 2025 Revenue : $40.7 billion vs $38.02 billion expected.

: $40.7 billion vs $38.02 billion expected. Q1 2025 Adjusted EPS: $0.49 vs $0.0 expected.

The company posted adjusted EBIT of $1 billion, down 63% from Q1 2024. Ford said its first-quarter EBIT suffered a nearly $200 million hit from added tariff costs, primarily in Ford Blue and Ford Pro.

Ford Pro generated an EBIT of $1.3 billion, Ford Blue $96 million, and Ford Model e reported an EBIT loss of $849 million.

For Model e, the company is focused on improving gross margins and “exercising a disciplined approach to investments in battery facilities and next-generation products.” Although still a nearly $1 billion loss, it’s still a $500 million improvement from Q1 2024.

Ford said higher Model e revenue was driven by new EVs launching in Europe, like the electric Explorer and Capri.

The company said its “Power Promise” promotion, which includes a free home charger and several other benefits, has helped drive demand in the US.

Although it’s tracking within its previous full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of between $7 billion and $8.5 billion, Ford is suspending full-year guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs.

2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E (Source: Ford)

Ford estimates the full-year gross cost of tariffs to be around $2.5 billion. It expects a tariff-related net adverse adjusted EBIT impact of about $1.5 billion for the full year 2025.

Ford also extended its “From America, For America” campaign last week. The promo includes employee pricing on most 2024 and 2025 models and now runs through July 4.

Yahoo Entertainment,Palantir (PLTR) Traders Brace for 12% Post-Earnings Swing,,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR, Financials) will report quarterly results after the market closes Monday, and traders are bracing for a major move. Options pricing implies a swing of more than 12%, which could push the stock to a new all-time high near $139or knock it back to $108.

Palantir has become a standout in 2025, rising more than 60% year to date, even as the S&P 500 has slipped more than 3%. That momentum builds on its 340% surge in 2024, making it the index's best performer last year as well.

Much of that strength comes from surging demand for artificial intelligence tools and a flood of government contracts. More than 40% of Palantir's fourth-quarter revenue came from U.S. federal agencies. While cost-cutting under President Trump and Elon Musk raises some uncertainty, Palantir's focus on defense and immigration tech puts it in step with the administration's priorities.

The company has a pattern of delivering upside surprises. It rallied more than 20% after each of its last two earnings releases, citing strong adoption of its AI platform and revenue growth above 30%.

Still, Wall Street isn't sold. Only one analyst currently rates the stock a buy, citing valuation concerns after its meteoric run. But Palantir's retail following remains loyal. According to Vanda Research, it's the third most popular stock among individual investors, trailing only Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) and Tesla (TSLA, Financials).

Investors will be watching closely to see if the earnings match the hypeand whether the rally has room to continue.

Black Leftist Moves to Africa and Discovers That America Isn’t So Bad After All

the liberty daily ^ | Zero Hedge

Posted on by NoLibZone

Millions of Americans, including those among the lowest income brackets, truly have no idea how good life is for them. The grass is always greener somewhere else in the world until people actually take the plunge and move to the neighbor’s house only to discover it’s crack den.

The self hatred that progressives feel over being American and living in the US is a first-world luxury that few others can afford. Most of humanity doesn’t have time to dwell obsessively on their nation’s global image; they are too busy barely surviving. The argument often regurgitated by over-privileged activists on Reddit forums and in college classrooms is that American “exceptionalism” is problematic because there’s nothing exceptional about America.

This claim is debunked by the fact that most of the rest of the world wants to come to the US and very few people want to leave. Those that do leave are usually among the wealthiest, or, they are gullible and think they can find something better overseas. It usually doesn’t go well for them.

One black leftist recently figured this out after moving to Africa. She assumed she would fit right in, but now says she actually prefers dealing with American “racism” over the scammers, grifters and of course, the lack of snacks. Her complaints have gone viral because they expose the common leftist delusion that the US is somehow one of the worst places on Earth. They simply don’t understand how lucky they are until they step outside of their echo chamber.

A minimal amount of research will drudge up numerous accounts similar to this one – Most black Americans simply cannot assimilate after relocating to Africa and most Americans don’t do well in regions devoid of western culture. The ultra-rich are fine wherever they go, but middle class expatriats have difficult experiences. Black comedians and celebrities have been trying to warn their community for decades about this. The venerable Patrice O’Neil didn’t mince words on the idea of “going back to Africa”.

When confronting the issue of racism in America, it should be noted that most of the world treats Black Americans differently. Not necessarily because of skin color but because of their cultural habits and behaviors.

Perhaps what black leftists in America interpret as “racism” is actually cultural burnout; a national or even global acknowledgment by other groups that they are tired of dealing with all the baggage that the black American community tends to bring with them? And if this is the case, then it’s unlikely that there are many other places in the world that will give them the time of day the way American society does.

That's fair. And I believe Kenya experienced a great Christian revival in the early 20th century. IMHO, that's the difference maker. The western world had the First and Second Great Awakenings (some say the revival in the 20th century was enough to call it a 3rd Great Awakening). Most sub-Saharan nations didn't have that kind of culture improvement.

And the more we let the God-denying, baby-killing, pedo-pushing, warmageddon cult left move us away from our Christian culture, the more we risk becoming like much of Africa.

TechCrunch,Elon Musk took a chainsaw to the US government — Tesla is taking the hit,,"Elon Musk has long been credited with turning Tesla into a beacon of innovation, the visionary who pushed the world into an era of electrification. But his slide into politics — specifically his alignment with President Trump and activities within the federal government — has dragged Tesla into uncertainty.

For many would-be Tesla buyers, the brand has lost its progressive luster. And while Musk has long been the face of Tesla, that link has taken a negative turn as the billionaire oversees mass layoffs and the elimination of federal programs via the Department of Government Efficiency.

Tesla’s disappointing first-quarter earnings, which saw profits drop 71% amid weakened sales and anti-Musk sentiment, demonstrate just how much the brand has fallen out of favor. The company reported 336,681 deliveries in the first three months of 2025, down from 495,570 in Q4 2024 and 386,810 in the first quarter of last year. That’s off the back of an unimpressive 2024, which saw fewer deliveries than the year prior amid production delays and increased EV competition.

For many, Musk’s political activities have turned Tesla into a symbolic pariah. Tesla trade-ins have hit record highs, while sales in Europe have dropped. Foreign leaders are calling for boycotts and the automaker’s stock price has lost about half its value since December. All the while, protesters continue to assemble outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations in an effort to accelerate the automaker’s brand devaluation and with it, they hope, Musk’s wealth.

“They have a certain significant public image problem that’s really something we haven’t seen before in this industry,” Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, told TechCrunch.

Even one of Tesla’s most unwavering bulls, Dan Ives, has begged Musk to focus less on politics and more on his business “or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla.” And even though Musk said last month that he’d take a step back from DOGE, he’s not giving up on it either.



To combat the effect this might have on Tesla, Musk has and likely will continue to lean on his sales pitch that Tesla isn’t an automaker, it’s an AI company, one that will someday commercialize autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

The question now is whether the Tesla brand can recover.

Below are the moments, which TechCrunch will continue to update, that are shaping perception of the Tesla brand and may have a lasting effect on its future.

Drop in European sales

Tesla’s new car sales have plunged across Europe, even as sales of electric cars made by other brands rose on the continent. In the first four months of 2025, Tesla sales dropped 37.2% in Europe, and in Sweden, they dropped 81% year-over-year.

Germany, traditionally one of Tesla’s largest markets and home to one of its gigafactories, has turned against Musk in a big way. A recent survey of 100,000 Germans found 94% would never purchase a Tesla, and sales data backs that up. In March 2025, Tesla’s Germany sales were down 42.5%. A slight increase from the 75% sales slump in February.

Succession

The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Tesla’s board began searching for Musk’s potential successor sometime around early April as Musk waded further into Washington to slash government spending.

When the report came out, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm declared the WSJ’s reporting to be “absolutely false.” Either way, the report does raise questions about succession planning if Musk-associated brand devaluation continues. Musk said during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call that he would take a step back from DOGE, but, importantly, he also said he’d continue working for the agency for the remainder of Trump’s presidency.

Protests are officially a risk

“Tesla Takedown” protests have been spreading around the world with the goal of encouraging people to stop buying Teslas and to sell their Tesla stock, which protesters say will hurt Musk where he holds most of his power — in his wallet (more on those below). As of the first quarter of this year, those protests have officially become an official risk in Tesla’s regulatory filings.

The new risk factor in Tesla’s latest SEC filings warns that certain criticism “has incited protests, some escalating to violence targeting our operations, products and personnel.” Tesla’s lawyers also expanded what’s at risk, saying negative perceptions resulting from the protests, along with the broader criticism of the company, “may harm our brand and our business (including sales) and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.”

Tariff exposure

While Tesla is the automaker best positioned to parry the blow of Trump’s automotive tariffs in the U.S., the company is still exposed due to Musk’s alliance with the president.

In April, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cut Tesla’s price target to $315, down from $550, once again citing Musk’s politics creating a brand crisis for the automaker. He also noted that Musk’s association with Trump, and therefore his tariff policies, are not only affecting sales in the U.S. and Europe, but also threatening Tesla’s popularity in China, “further driv[ing] Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD.”

While recent studies found that Musk’s political leanings have lost him customers in what has historically been Tesla’s base — Democrats — the shift has garnered him street cred with Republicans. One study from researchers at Northeastern University, Columbia University, and the University of Iowa found that Republicans’ likelihood to purchase a Tesla moved up from 7% before Musk’s Trump endorsement to 10.2% after.

That sentiment might only increase amid Trump’s reciprocal endorsement of Musk and Tesla, including his free commercial at the White House on March 11.

“Hang on to your stock”

At an impromptu, glitchy, livestreamed Tesla all-hands presentation on the evening of March 20, Musk told his employees and investors to “hang on to [their] stock” despite it feeling “like Armageddon.”

“It’s very difficult for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people, to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,” Musk said, referring to the now-defunct claim that all existing Teslas have the hardware necessary to turn into fully self-driving cars with a mere software update.

He advised employees to tune out the noise and focus on building the Cybercab, which would be the new priority. The Cybercab is a two-seater robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. Current federal regulations don’t allow for the mass production of such vehicles because they don’t have human controls, but Musk has signaled an intent to amend those rules.

He noted that the Cybercab manufacturing process would be a feat of engineering, a “high-speed consumer electronics line” that “will move so fast that … it’ll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds.”

During the call, Musk also promised to produce about 5,000 Optimus robots this year, which he believes will be Tesla’s most valuable asset.

“Moment of truth”

On the same day as the sudden all-hands, Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note that Musk’s involvement in DOGE has led to a “brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla.”

“If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol … and this is a bad thing,” Ives wrote.

Molotov cocktails and vandalism

Tesla showrooms, charging stations, facilities, and even privately owned vehicles have been hit with attacks. In some cases, the damage is minimal — some spray paint and a keyed car. In others, violence has ensued. Dealerships have been hit with bullets and Molotov cocktails, and charging stations have been set on fire.

Musk has responded by questioning why anyone would want to hurt Tesla.

Trump’s response has been more pointed. He has declared that any acts of violence — which could include spray-painting — would be treated by the federal government as domestic terrorism.

“I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20-year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.

As of the time of this writing, the Department of Justice has brought charges against three individuals who are allegedly responsible for violent destruction of Tesla properties.

Tesla Takedowns

Peaceful protests have also erupted across the country as part of the Tesla Takedown movement.

Protesters have been showing up at Tesla dealerships and showrooms to try to discourage people from buying Tesla cars. They also aim to encourage Tesla owners to trade in their vehicles and Tesla stockholders to sell their shares.

Despite these protests being peaceful, we’re beginning to see the start of violent counterprotests — like the Florida man who drove his SUV into a crowd of protestors outside a Palm Beach Tesla dealership in March.

Associating with the Proud Boys

Thousands of people joined in Tesla Takedown protests the last weekend in March at showrooms across the country. The crowds drew small numbers of counterprotests in some regions that were peopled mainly by MAGA supporters, Wired reports. Among them were far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys and armed militias.

The “Roman” salute

While speaking at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration in January, Musk did what many have perceived to be not one, but two, Nazi salutes.

The damage has only been amplified by Musk’s vocal support for the far-right German political party AfD, as well as his history of sharing antisemitic posts.

Shortly after the salute incident, activists projected an image of Musk doing the salute, along with the word “Heil,” onto Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory.

BYD breakthroughs

One of Tesla’s biggest competitors, China’s BYD, has been touting significant breakthroughs in charging. The automaker said this week that its new cars can be charged in five minutes, which would give it a huge competitive edge over Tesla and indeed any other EV maker.

China is one of Tesla’s largest markets, but BYD is continuing to bully the automaker on its home turf. BYD recently unveiled its “God’s Eye” advanced driver-assistance system — akin to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD — that will be installed at no additional cost on its entire EV lineup, including its ultra-cheap $9,600 Seagull hatchback.

BYD continues to impress consumers with its high-tech range of EVs and hybrids and has once again surpassed Tesla on revenue. In 2024, BYD reported $107 billion in revenue compared to Tesla’s $97.7 billion.

An aging lineup and Cybertruck recalls

Tesla has languished with an aging lineup for years. The Cybertruck was meant to be the automaker’s next big bet that would prove it’s still capable of delivering innovative new models. And indeed, the truck has been popular among American buyers.

Still, Tesla has issued eight recalls on the Cybertruck since launching the vehicle in November 2023. Most recently, Tesla had to recall 46,000 Cybertrucks because of an exterior steel trim panel on the side of the windshield that looks like it was stuck on with superglue and can just peel off.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/elon-musk-took-a-chainsaw-to-the-us-government-tesla-is-taking-the-hit/,2025-05-05 00:00:00
ABC News,OpenAI says its nonprofit will continue to control its business,,"OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the business that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products

After months spent pursuing a plan to convert itself into a for-profit business, OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the company that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.

“We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,” said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.

Altman and the chair of OpenAI’s nonprofit board, Bret Taylor, said the board made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI. The nonprofit already has a for-profit arm, but that arm will be converted into a public benefit corporation “that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission,” Taylor said.

OpenAI’s co-founders, including Altman and Tesla CEO Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity’s benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.

OpenAI first outlined plans last year to convert its core governance structure but faced a number of challenges. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led Musk to invest in the charity. A federal judge last week dismissed some of Musk's claims and allowed others to proceed to a trial set for next year.

OpenAI also faced scrutiny from the top law enforcement officers in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, and California, where it operates out of a San Francisco headquarters.",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/openai-reverses-nonprofit-continue-control-business-121482166,
Electrek,Chery is deploying an army of blonde humanoid robots called Mornine to sell its cars [Video],,"If you thought Tesla or XPeng’s bipedal humanoid robots were a creepy glimpse into the future, wait until you see what Chinese automaker Chery Automotive is deploying. Alongside business partner AiMOGA, Chery is encouraging its dealers to purchase a Mornine robot to help sell vehicles to customers. Mornine definitely won’t scare anyone away, right?

Chery Automotive has been developing vehicles for nearly 30 years in China and operates under the ownership of the Wuhu municipal government, where it is headquartered. We’ve previously covered several of Chery’s sub-brands, including Luxeed, and Omoda.

In addition to cars, Chery has become yet another automaker exploring bipedal humanoid robots. In June 2024, Chery announced a strategic partnership with AI and robotics specialist AiMOGA to develop a new humanoid robot called Mornine, promising to “usher in a wholly innovative customer ecosystem service system.”

Less than a year later, Mornine was strutting her stuff around Chery’s booth at the Shanghai Auto Show before a crowd of the blonde robots stood behind Zhang Guibing, president of Chery International, during a dealer and media event in its home city of Wuhu.

We’d argue that bipedal humanoid robots are already too close to a Terminator-like dystopia. Hence, adding hair and makeup (and some surprising junk in Mornine’s trunk) makes things a helluva lot more creepy. You have to listen to her speak in the video below.

Chery’s Mornine robot is awesome, but gives us the creeps

While Mornine is new to us, the sunglass-clad, ponytailed robot from Chery and AiMOGA has been in the public eye for about a year now. It was only during Chery’s recent press events, however, that we learned how Mornine is expected to support the automaker. She(?) will be your local showroom specialist, of course!

According to Chery International’s president, the market for humanoid robots has more potential in the future than vehicles, and “AiMOGA is the real future for the Chery company.” Zhang said Mornine is the same price as a car, but could serve as a home assistant, or you can buy a second robot to help you at work.

However, personal robots are still more science fiction with an emphasis that leans more toward fiction, so Chery wants to get the word out about its technology and the use cases it can one day provide the world. To do so, Chery is hoping to deploy the Mornine robots to vehicle showrooms to assist customers in learning more about available models (see more in the video below).

Those aren’t just cool shades AiMOGA equipped Mornine with – they house surround-view vision. Mornine also has fully flexible hands that can serve customers drinks and female-like vocal capabilities to answer vehicle questions.

Zhang told the crowd of over 3,000 in Wuhu that Chery would offer a discount on Mornine to any interested customers, although that amount was not publicly revealed. One Mornine robot has already been working on a trial basis at a Chery dealership in Malaysia.

Chery has promised to deliver 220 Mornine robots this year to dealers worldwide. That’s not enough to garner full-fledged panic about a humanoid robot takeover, but it’s as scary as it is exciting.

The Times of India,"Europe pushes back against US tariffs, saying 'No thanks' to buying American",,"Live Events

For motorcycle lovers in Sweden, Harley-Davidson is the hottest brand on the road. Jack Daniels whiskey beckons from the bar at British pubs. In France, Levis jeans are all about chic.But in the tumult of President Donald Trump 's trade war with Europe, many European consumers are starting to avoid US products and services in what appears to be a decisive and potentially long-term shift away from buying American, according to a new assessment by the European Central Bank In April, Trump imposed a 10% blanket tariff on America's trading partners and threatened ""reciprocal tariffs"" on many of those, including the European Union. Companies like Tesla and McDonald's are seeing customers in Europe put off by ""Made in America.""""The newly imposed US trade tariffs on European products are causing European consumers to think twice about what's in their shopping cart,"" the ECB wrote in a blog post about its research on consumer behavior. ""Consumers are very willing to actively move away from US products and services.""Europeans had already begun testing grassroots boycotts on American products, including Heinz ketchup and Lay's potato chips, shortly after Trump took office. His threats to take over Greenland, part of Denmark, energised Danes to organize no-buy campaigns on Facebook. Tesla owners in Sweden slapped ""shame"" bumper stickers on their cars to distance themselves from Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO who is one of Trump's top advisers.But Europeans' anguish over Trump's treatment of America's longtime allies has hardened as he has moved to rewire world trade with steep global tariffs, the central bank found.Trump took particular aim at the European Union, which he called ""very, very bad to us"" for not buying more from the United States, and threatened the bloc with a 20% ""reciprocal"" tariff last month. Such talk bewildered many Europeans and rattled EU leaders, who retaliated with a 25% duty on many U.S. goods.Both sides called a temporary truce after Trump abruptly reversed course and delayed tariffs until the summer. But the 10% baseline tariff is still in place, and a trans-Atlantic trade war could easily flare again.And even if a trade deal is reached, Europe's newfound wariness of its longtime ally will not easily be unwound. The ECB study found that even if a mere 5% tax were placed on American products sold in Europe, Europeans would still be inclined to shun them.What is new, the central bank said, is a ""preference"" among European consumers ""to move away from U.S. products and brands altogether,"" no matter what the cost. That was the case even for households that could bear the brunt of higher prices.""Even though they could afford more expensive U.S. products and services, they consciously choose alternatives,"" the bank said. ""This suggests that consumers' reactions may not just be a temporary response to tariff increases, but instead signal a possible long-term structural shift in consumer preferences away from U.S. products and brands.""In Germany and Italy, developers have created apps that scan grocery and clothing items for people who want to make sure they are not buying American. The top app, BrandSnap, even suggests European alternatives.On a French-run ""Boycott USA!"" Facebook channel with 31,000 members, people boast about buying Adidas, a German brand, over Nike and New Balance, and post stories about avoiding travel to the United States.In a Danish Facebook group with 95,000 members, people try to help each other figure out if products like Gillette Mach 3 razor blades or Schweppes soda are from the United States. One run from Sweden promotes alternatives to Airbnb and is calling for a European boycott on Meta platforms for a week in May.Europeans have also posted online to say they have begun canceling subscriptions to US streaming giants, including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video.Some consumers who have boycotted Amazon have gone online to lament that delivery from alternate ecommerce platforms in their countries are slower or less reliable but say that they are staying the course.Millions of people still buy American goods and services worldwide, but US companies and investors are keeping a close eye on international markets for signs of anti-American sentiment related to Trump's policies.In Europe, Tesla sales continued a sharp decline in April, data showed, including an 81% plunge in Sweden from a year ago, as protests against Musk's political views have held steady.And McDonald's said it was observing growing negative attitudes abroad toward US brands, especially in Northern Europe and Canada.International consumers are ""going to be cutting back their purchase of American brands, and we've seen an uptick in anti-American sentiment,"" the burger chain's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said in a call with analysts last week.The McDonald's brand does not seem to have been damaged yet -- same-store sales in Canada and Europe were down only 1% in the first quarter from a year ago. But there is an ""8- to a 10-point increase in anti-American sentiment,"" he said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/europe-pushes-back-against-us-tariffs-saying-no-thanks-to-buying-american/articleshow/120906620.cms,

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were lower on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump rekindled worries about the fallout of a global trade war by introducing new tariffs, while focus remained on the Federal Reserve 's monetary policy decision later this week.On Sunday, Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. but offered little clarity on how the levies would be implemented.Several movie and television production companies took a hit. Netflix fell 2.1% and was set to snap an 11-session winning streak, while Amazon.com was down 1.2%. Paramount Global slipped 1%.However, the top indexes were well above their session lows, as investors hoped for some reprieve on the trade tariff front with negotiation talks underway.""The market has a slight positive lean towards it right now, believing that these trade tariffs are either going to be reduced or they're going to come to some type of an agreement,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.Markets were also taking a pause after the S&P 500 notched its ninth session of gains on Friday, a streak last seen in 2004.At 11:30 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.93 points, or 0.07%, to 41,344.36, the S&P 500 lost 21.19 points, or 0.37%, to 5,665.48 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 93.56 points, or 0.52%, to 17,884.17.Most megacap stocks were lower, with Tesla and Apple down over 3% each, while gains in some financial stocks buoyed the Dow.Energy stocks were the biggest loser, down 1.7% as crude prices dropped on anticipation of increased supply by OPEC+ countries.Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway were down 4.4% after Warren Buffett said he will step down as CEO of the conglomerate.

Thegatewaypundit.com,Legal Immigrant from Africa Has Message for ‘Spoiled’ Protesting Leftists: “How can you hate one man just because he love his country?” (Video),,"Leftists across the country, many of whom are Boomers trying to relive their “glory days” of the 60’s, continue to protest against Donald Trump’s efforts to Make America Great Again.

While they lecture us to “believe all women,” they shout about bringing back a man who woke up in the middle of the night to slap his wife.

They shout about DOGE finding diabolical waste of taxpayer’s hard earned money across every component of the federal government because, apparently, they want the waste.

A legal immigrant from Africa, whose name is Fayz, had strong words for spoiled protestors and their endless public tantrums.

Fayz shared, “I’ve never seen such hate in a country like America. The way they hate only one man. Americans have been spoiled, and they think that the more they make noise, the more they get things done.”

“To get things done, calls for what? Pragmatic assessment on how you’re going to get things done. Not this wasting of time and just protesting somebody who loves this country. In my life, I’ve never seen such hate in a country like America, the way they hate only one man. How is that possible?”

“How can you hate one man just because he love his country? What is this?”

“I travel all the way from Africa to come to this country legally to make sure I realize the American dream. My kids are born here.”

Washingtonspectator.org,"America’s Slide into Authoritarianism, as seen from TED 2025",,"Historians (if they exist in the future and any records of this period survive) will note this month as one where the United States slipped fully into authoritarianism. Incompetence, luck, and real leadership may yet intervene, but we have already crossed several “red lines” warned about by experts.

At the TED conference this past week in Vancouver, British Columbia, about 1,700 multidisciplinary thinkers gathered to hear and discuss dozens of prepared talks. But the real action was among the attendees, who gathered all week in impromptu salon discussions to share their concerns about the state of the world and what can be done to change course. Here are some of the most discussed topics and themes.

It’s a Coup

Carole Cadwalladr, a journalist who has reported on tech overreach and the rise of data-driven authoritarianism, delivered a powerful talk in which she correctly stated what many are afraid to admit: It’s a coup. The purchase of an American president (and American sovereignty) by Elon Musk is unprecedented, and it appears to be advancing unabated.

In her conference-opening talk, she also confronted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the theft of her intellectual property to train the company’s AI systems. When TED’s Chris Anderson brought up this concern with Altman in an interview during the final conference session (with Cadwalladr applauding) Altman’s response directed to her was, “Clap all you want to about that. Enjoy.” When Cadwalladr confronted him again privately backstage, he waved her off, citing “fair use.”

While the TED community is comprised of a wide range of people, a broad majority of participants appeared to align with Cadwalladr, agreeing that AI companies are overreaching, and violating property laws. Shortly after the interview with Altman, Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey seemed to offer support for Altman’s view, posting “delete all ip law” on X, with Elon Musk replying, “I agree.”

Crossing the Rubicon into Authoritarianism

In the course of just a few days, Americans have cataloged a laundry list of signs that the country has reached a tipping point into authoritarianism: SignalGate; “Liberation Day” tariffs; reversal of (some) tariffs (maybe); deportations to El Salvador; defiance of the Supreme Court; asserting that “home growns” (aka citizens) are next; taking control of Columbia University by placing it into receivership; bullying law firms to provide pro-bono services supportive of the regime; indiscriminate revocation of student visas; calling for the revocation of the broadcast license for CBS over dislike of 60 Minutes content; attempts to criminalize media figures like Norm Eisen; investigation of former Trump administration officials Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs on grounds of treason; forcing Americans to use X to interact with the Social Security administration; widespread DOGE cuts of programs and agencies without Congressional approval; decline of the dollar under pressure from tariffs and market chaos. The list goes on and on.

People also expressed grave concerns about interacting with US Customs, and discussed strategies for dealing with their devices at the border crossing. One TED speaker, a comedian, returning to the States was asked if they made any mention of politicians in their talk. Other attendees discussed strategies for locking down their computers and phones (“create a user account with nothing special in it” or “turn off Face ID and decline to provide a PIN.”) Some discussed mailing their devices home to avoid having them on their person. Regardless of the details, it is a massive red flag that law abiding citizens of any country are having to consider such strategies, with most expressing deep alarm at that fact.

Many also shared their intention to establish residency outside the United States. While the stereotype of liberals fleeing conservative regimes goes back decades, concerns now transcend mere political displeasure.

Some involved in media, non-profits, relief work, science, and other efforts requiring international coordination are now wondering if they will be able to remain in the United States without interference. Large, established non-profit organizations now face the prospect of having their tax status revoked, which can be executed as an administrative action within the Internal Revenue Service with no due process.

The United States has transformed into a fully authoritarian kleptocracy. If the government can take control of a private university (Columbia), independent non-profits (US Institute of Peace), detain and search citizens at the border without a warrant, disappear residents (and soon citizens) to a prison another country with no recourse, and defy the Supreme Court, it’s clear that the Constitution simply no longer applies.

Canada Isn’t Having It

Speaking with Canadians, they are re-energized at the thought of recasting Canadian identity in contrast to their delinquent neighbors to the south. Where the Canadian flag was, a year ago, a symbol of right-wing nationalism, today it represents level-headed liberalism. In Vancouver, it is not uncommon to see the maple leaf flag displayed proudly beside a flag for Ukraine — unthinkable a year ago.

The selection of Prime Minister Mark Carney seems to have been a stroke of genius that may ward off the advances of the lab-grown libertarian Pierre Poilievre, who otherwise might have had a better chance to move Canada more in the direction of Trumpian policy. People here do not take the idea of Canada becoming a “51st State” even remotely seriously, and when one considers the diversity and density of Canada’s largest cities, it’s obvious that any Americans floating this idea have no idea what they’re talking about. Canada’s national election on April 28 will offer a clearer idea about where the country is headed, but right now it appears to be on a hopeful trajectory.

Living in the Matrix?

Being TED, the idea that we might be living in a simulation naturally came up amongst the assembled technologists, philosophers, and scientists. But most concluded that no such exotic explanation was necessary to explain what we observe.

Individuals with high agency (such as Musk, Trump, Putin) have simply decided to ignore consensus reality and the laws and norms that previously shaped it. They are following their own agenda and we’re all being dragged into a new reality, whether we like it or not.

In fighting it, we are lured into engaging with the old systems — wasting time spinning the knobs labeled checks and balances, finding they do nothing. What may happen next is anyone’s guess. But we’re running out of time.

State level remedies (think Attorneys General and State Legislators taking action against Musk and friends) and actions by other countries (200% tariffs on Tesla in Europe, anyone?) might be solutions that can slow the grinding of our institutional gears.

Conferences Are People

There’s plenty else going on in the world of TED, as usual — talks touting advancements in science, AI, the arts, medicine, and the like. You’ll see those talks online soon. TED itself is in the process of gifting itself to a new owner, and they’re reviewing proposals for that now. Some of the talks and sessions inadvertently advanced some unsavory agendas. And there’s plenty of room for principled critique of TED and its model, with its tendency towards a glossy blend of feel-good slacktivism and McLuhan-cool presentations.

But the conference itself is loaded with smart, interesting people from around the world, genuinely trying to do good and useful work. The real conversations are in the hallways, at the bar, and at dinner. And never in sixteen years of attendance at various TED events have I heard those people more concerned about the state of the world.

New York Post,Elon Musk’s security guards at ‘Fort Knox’ Texas compound called cops on neighbor they thought was naked: report,,"High fences make bad neighbors.

At least that’s what those living near Elon Musk’s “Fort Knox” high-walled compound near Austin, Texas, claim — including allegations that the mogul’s security forces called the cops on one neighbor for allegedly standing naked in the street.

Paul Hemmer, a retired real estate agent and head of the neighborhood homeowners association in West Lake Hills, has been among the most vocal residents complaining about Musk’s alleged zoning code violations.

He told the New York Times that he has been under constant surveillance from Musk’s security cameras, which were installed on the grounds of a property that the billionaire mogul purchased with the intention of merging with two other adjacent lots to serve as a compound for him, his 13 kids and their mothers.

“I call that place Fort Knox,” Hemmer told the Times.

Last year, Musk’s security team accused Hemmer of indecent behavior, alleging he was nude outside his home.

Hemmer denied that he was naked and said he was on his property wearing black underwear.

On another occasion, Hemmer stopped to urinate while walking his dog — which Musk’s security surveillance captured.

“The cameras got me,” Hemmer told the Times. “It’s scary they have guys sitting and watching me pee.”

Hemmer’s outrage at Musk prompted him to fly a video-equipped drone over his property in a bid to document alleged violations, the Times reported.

Hemmer and other residents of an upscale cul-de-sac in West Lake Hills, an affluent suburb just west of Austin, launched a formal complaint against Musk after he moved in to their neighborhood in 2022.

The world’s richest man — whose portfolio of companies includes Tesla, SpaceX, X and Neuralink, — purchased the $6 million, 6,900-square-foot mansion through a limited liability company.

Musk’s arrival in the neighborhood, however, was anything but subtle as neighbors soon observed unsettling changes, the Times reported.

Workers installed a towering 16-foot chain-link fence around the property — significantly exceeding local height restrictions — accompanied by outward-facing surveillance cameras.

The fence is 10 feet higher than zoning ordinances permit, according to the Times.

Traffic congestion soon became another sore point.

Residents noted fleets of vehicles, particularly Teslas, routinely parked on their previously serene streets.

Security personnel, identifiable by their firearm holsters, changed shifts three times daily, adding to neighborhood frustrations, according to the Times.

The scale of the construction also violated at least six city ordinances, the Times reported.

Musk’s representatives sought to retroactively gain permission for the various construction projects in and around the property, but were denied last month, according to the outlet.

Hemmer, whose house is located across the street from Musk’s compound, voiced his irritation in a formal complaint to the city.

“Transporting service employees to other houses, leaving their cars on our quiet streets, hauling laundry to and fro to other houses has to stop,” he wrote in the complaint.

Hemmer and other neighbors formally appealed to the West Lake Hills Zoning and Planning Commission, stating that Musk was effectively operating a security business from his residence.

Last month, the commission unanimously sided with the neighbors.

Commissioner Jim Pledger emphasized the seriousness of the infractions, declaring: “If an exception was made, we’d incentivize people to break the rules.”

The West Lake Hills city council will review the zoning commission’s decision on May 14. Musk faces a potential mandate to dismantle his non-compliant installations.

In a bid to justify Musk’s actions, his representatives cited ongoing security threats to the billionaire.

Longtime resident Anne Yeakel questioned Musk’s decision to move to the neighborhood.

“Castles are supposed to be built on hills, right?” she remarked.

“These were sophisticated buyers, and if security was the prime directive, this was not the house for it.”",https://nypost.com/2025/05/05/business/elon-musks-security-guards-called-cops-on-neighbor-they-thought-was-naked/,2025-05-05 00:00:00
Newser,Musk's Most Important Mission Isn't DOGE or EVs,,"Elon Musk is shifting away from DOGE to refocus on Tesla, and James Pethokoukis writes in a Washington Post essay that it can't happen soon enough. The reason is not because of politics or even electric cars. Pethokoukis, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, makes the case that it's essential Musk return to Tesla because ""the company's future, and perhaps the world's, rests on building a different product: the perfect robot."" Tesla is working on a prototype of a humanoid robot called Optimus, and Musk has predicted that much of Tesla's future value rests on it. And yes, Musk loves to over-hype things, but Pethokoukis agrees with the sentiment that humanoid robots are on the cusp of changing the world, much in the same way smartphones have.",https://www.newser.com/story/368171/musks-most-important-mission-isnt-doge-or-evs.html,2025-05-05 15:28:00-05:00
The Daily Caller,Prosecutor Who Let Tesla Vandal Off Easy Now Under DOJ Probe For Race-Based Policy,,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into whether a Minnesota prosecutor’s office is violating the Constitution by pledging to factor defendants’ skin color into plea deals.

Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon announced on Saturday that the DOJ will review the new policy at Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty’s office to see “whether the [office] is engaged in a pattern or practice of depriving persons of rights,” as described in a letter to Hennepin County. The probe adds to ongoing scrutiny of Moriarty’s policies since she came into the spotlight in April for refusing to prosecute a state official who vandalized Tesla vehicles.

This week we @TheJusticeDept @CivilRights opened a racial discrimination pattern and practice investigation into Hennepin County, Minnesota’s recently announced policy of taking race into consideration in plea offers. More to come. pic.twitter.com/VLn1998Obl — AAGHarmeetDhillon (@AAGDhillon) May 4, 2025

The letter came in response to an April memo from Moriarty’s office that says prosecutors negotiating plea deals “should consider the person charged as a whole person, including their racial identity and age” and address “racial disparities” in the justice system.

The memo pairs the racial and age considerations with an overall strategy to give defendants “a nonincarceration option” based on prosecutors’ “individual analyses.”

“While these factors should not be controlling, they should be part of the overall analysis,” reads the memo. (RELATED: Prosecutor Under Fire Over Tesla Vandal Case Decides It’s Time To Focus On ‘Racial Disparities’ In Sentencing)

The DOJ’s letter called the policy “discriminatory.” It also said Dhillon will lead “a comprehensive review of all … policies and practices” at the office “that may involve the illegal consideration of race in prosecutorial decision-making.”

“The use of ‘racial identity’ in prosecutorial decisions, including whether to depart from Sentencing Guidelines, is another example of how deeply Critical Race Theory has penetrated society,” Cornell law professor William A. Jacobson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Jacobson founded the Equal Protection Project, an initiative by the conservative Legal Insurrection Foundation.

“What once was a fringe academic theory has expanded from higher education into society, including the legal system,” Jacobson said.

Moriarty’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, nor has it responded to several other DCNF inquiries since April about Moriarty’s policies. A spokesperson told FOX9 KMSP that it “will cooperate with any resulting investigation and we’re fully confident our policy complies with the law.”

Dhillon previously told the DCNF that she would return the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to its “traditional, core functions” such as combatting race-preferential policies. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Employers that discriminate against people on the basis of race and use quotas in hiring that are in no way justified,” Dhillon said in an April interview with the DCNF’s Katelynn Richardson. “Public sector employers will be getting inquiries from us, and so that’s a new priority that wasn’t being done before.”

Jacobson told the DCNF that shutting down Moriarty’s plea deal program would be a good step in the DOJ’s mission.

“The concept of giving someone a lighter sentence based on race is offensive and unlawful in its own right,” the professor said. “It is even worse because by granting a sentencing departure based on race the prosecutors are denying others a departure based on race. It’s straight up racism, and we hope the U.S. Department of Justice puts an end to it.”

Moriarty was also accused of being soft on crime in April for declining to charge a fiscal policy analyst for Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’ administration who keyed six Teslas in an attack on CEO Elon Musk’s company. Moriarty allowed the state official to pay victims restitution to avoid felony charges, telling reporters that “a felony conviction destabilizes” a person’s life and can therefore lead to “recidivism.”

“We are very much focused on public safety,” Moriarty said. “Now … there are some people who want people to have felony convictions. That’s fine if that’s what they want, but that is not about public safety.”

After speculation swirled around the potential for Tesla CEO Elon Musk to step down and replace him, a Tesla bull Gary Black, managing partner at The Future Fund LLC, was quick to shoot down the rumour, and also mentioned the consequences if this actually happens, as per a report.Black addressed this on social media platform X(previously Twitter), he wrote, ""I’m of the opinion that if @Elonmusk gave up his CEO role at $TSLA but continued in some role as Chief Technology Officer or Chief Product Officer, TSLA stock would fall by 5-10%,"" as per his X post.Black went on to say, ""If Elon left TSLA altogether I believe TSLA stock would fall by 20-25%."" emphasizing that ""For that reason I think the odds are low that the Board chooses someone to replace him,"" as per his X post.For context, Musk has long been a key driver in Tesla's success and its market value. Tesla's market cap is now at $880 billion, and Musk's leadership is perceived as essential in keeping that value, as per Benzinga.Black's remarks came within hours after Musk himself reacted to the rumours in an X post. He responded to a Wall Street Journal report of his possible removal, terming it as an “extremely bad breach of ethics” and accusing it of being a “deliberately false article,” as per Musk's X post.Though Black's critique is severe, it's not so far out of line with other Tesla bulls. Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, also commented on the rumours and opined that Musk will continue to be CEO for at least five years, as per Benzinga. Ives further opined that the rumours of Musk leaving might be nothing more than a ""warning shot"" by the board, according to Benzinga.There have been reports suggesting that Tesla’s board might be considering replacing Musk, as per Benzinga. However, Musk has denied it.Black suggested that Musk’s departure would result in a significant drop in Tesla’s stock, possibly wiping out $220 billion in shareholder value, as per Benzinga.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/if-elon-musk-quits-as-ceo-teslas-valuation-could-drop-by-a-massive-25-warns-gary-black-heres-a-complete-breakdown-of-what-he-said/articleshow/120904128.cms,
The Verge,"Waymo says it will add 2,000 more robotaxis into 2026",,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Waymo said it recently received its last delivery of Jaguar I-Pace SUVs, which will be retrofitted with sensors and autonomous driving technology at its factory in Arizona, before joining its robotaxi fleet.

In a blog post published today, the Alphabet company said it currently has 1,500 Jaguars operating across its four main markets: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin. And it plans on adding 2,000 more vehicles into 2026, for a total fleet size of 3,500. The company recently hit an average of 250,000 paid passenger trips per week.

Waymo typically doesn’t like to comment on the size of its fleet, so today’s announcement provides a rare glimpse into the number of robotaxis the company currently has in operation. Waymo’s plans to scale up comes as the company eyes Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, DC for launch in 2026.

The Jaguar I-Pace has been the company’s primary vehicle since Waymo retired its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans in 2023. The company had once projected it would have 20,000 I-Paces operating as robotaxis, but appears to have fallen significantly short of that goal. Waymo is also currently testing and validating two new models, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the all-electric Zeekr RT minivan, but has yet to say when they will join the fleet.

Waymo assembles its robotaxis with the help of auto engineering company Magna International at a 239,000 square-foot factory in Mesa, Arizona. The company’s final batch of Jaguar I-Paces will be assembled there, which should carry Waymo through to next year. And starting in 2026, Waymo will begin work on its sixth generation “Waymo Driver,” which will launch in the Zeekr RT. Zeekr is a subsidiary of Geely, which is one of China’s largest automakers.

The new robotaxi is being designed in Sweden (where Geely owns Swedish carmaker Volvo), adapted from Geely’s all-electric five-door Zeekr. Waymo is then importing the vehicles to Arizona, where they will be outfitted with the hardware and software necessary for autonomous driving. The first test vehicles began arriving in the US last year.

In order to adapt to multiple vehicle platforms, Waymo says its Mesa factory will add automated assembly lines and “other efficiencies” over time. And when it’s operating at full capacity, the company expects it will be able to churn out “tens of thousands” of robotaxis each year. Waymo added new processes at the end of the assembly line for passenger validation and commission to ensure each vehicle is ready to accept riders as soon as it leaves the factory. Each vehicle drives itself into service after leaving the factory, where it is ready for passenger pickups within 30 minutes, according to Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli.",https://www.theverge.com/news/661025/waymo-fleet-size-factory-arizona-jaguar-robotaxi-zeekr,2025-05-05 15:10:23+00:00

Tesla sparks firestorm after bold defense of self-driving tech: 'Car does it all for you'

Yahoo! / The Cool Down ^ | May 2, 2025 | Noah Jampol

Posted on by ProtectOurFreedom

Tesla is fighting back at criticism of its Full Self-Driving features. The EV automaker took to the social media platform X to provide a robust defense of FSD's current state and future.

While few would take issue with this point, many consumers have been underwhelmed with FSD's view of autonomy thus far, due to the need for drivers to be attentive.

Tesla pushed back, ""Although FSD Supervised currently does require your supervision, you will still notice that your commute or long drives are suddenly so much less taxing.""

Teslarati added context, saying FSD ""has a ton of potential."" And there are supporters of FSD who have credited the feature with not only saving them from dangerous potential collisions, but also making often-stressful driving more pleasant. A Tesla owner in China shared remarkable footage showing FSD thriving in difficult conditions.

Tesla laid out the selling points of FSD: ""No constant micro-adjustments in rush hour traffic. No frustration. Car does it all for you.""

Not everyone has had the same experience with FSD, as there are drivers who anecdotally say the tech has made inexplicable maneuvers into traffic, and YouTuber Mark Rober went viral showing Tesla's Autopilot system, which relies on the same hardware as FSD, fail to stop the vehicle from crashing into a wall painted to look like additional road .

Rober's criticism is that Tesla uses only cameras, albeit with great software, instead of including any radar or lidar detection. Tesla's China rollout also faced challenges with drivers getting fines as the result of system errors.

Tesla is undeterred by these developments, as they are looking to go a step further by introducing Unsupervised FSD to Austin by June. Two of their Gigafactory locations already use the tech for operations, and through the criticism, Tesla is moving forward quickly.

mark rober’s “test” was completely debunked. His scenerios were absurd and he had no idea how to actually turn FSD on or off. I’ve used it daily for about a year. It is not a robotaxi and you are told in many ways you have to be attentive. You don’t have to touch the steering wheel or pedals unless there’s an emergency or you want to impose your own idea of the route, speed, etc. Almost all my rides are done on FSD with no interventions except prompting a lane change as per my preference on the highway, or tweaking the speed. Parking lots are still a total mess. Not unsafe but you’ll sit there forever waiting for other cars/pedestrians, fouling up the works. Right now I think of it as a major assist in doing the work as someone who does not like driving, especially long distances, when I’m tired, etc. I feel that combined with my being attentive, eg scanning sides, rear, etc that I am safer with it than without it. If you’re looking for a complete robotaxi, uber etc it’s not ready and may never be. Personally, I would always be “in the driver’s seat” not matter what they promise. I think for 99.00/month it’s a bargain. I am not on Elon Musk’s payroll!!!

To: ProtectOurFreedom

Here in Austin, there are numerous Waymos-self driving cars. I hired one though Uber. It was a bit of a white knuckled ride solely due to my belief that the technology is not ready for prime time. I was wrong. It was a truly an amazing experience. As an added benefit, there were no tips and no AutoTune “music.”

I don’t think headlines are casually chosen. Yes, the article is about self-driving cars. But I think the headline is telling us that Elon Musk wants to sell you a dangerous car that will burn down your house. It will spark a firestorm while you are sleeping. Because Trump hatred determines all media narratives.

If this gets perfected to the stage that Americans and Western man can start socializing over drinks, long conversations, and cocktail parties again, our societies will reap great benefit from it. I think much bonding and openness, plain speaking, and reaching of bold decisions and agreements is left undone when the get together ends at 9:00 with a cup of coffee and goodnights, it isn’t how Western men have operated for thousands of years.

mark rober’s “test” was completely debunked. His scenerios were absurd and he had no idea how to actually turn FSD on or off. I’ve used it daily for about a year. It is not a robotaxi and you are told in many ways you have to be attentive. You don’t have to touch the steering wheel or pedals unless there’s an emergency or you want to impose your own idea of the route, speed, etc. Almost all my rides are done on FSD with no interventions except prompting a lane change as per my preference on the highway, or tweaking the speed. Parking lots are still a total mess. Not unsafe but you’ll sit there forever waiting for other cars/pedestrians, fouling up the works. Right now I think of it as a major assist in doing the work as someone who does not like driving, especially long distances, when I’m tired, etc. I feel that combined with my being attentive, eg scanning sides, rear, etc that I am safer with it than without it. If you’re looking for a complete robotaxi, uber etc it’s not ready and may never be. Personally, I would always be “in the driver’s seat” not matter what they promise. I think for 99.00/month it’s a bargain. I am not on Elon Musk’s payroll!!!

Livemint,Ather Energy IPO: Can India’s Tesla for two-wheelers beat Ola Electric on the markets?,,"Bengaluru: Shubham Asawa, a consultant at a Bengaluru-based tech startup, initially planned to buy a conventional scooter. He was considering models such as the Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter. Given the widespread complaints about Ola Electric’s service, he wasn’t even thinking about switching to an electric vehicle.

However, that changed when he spotted a billboard advertising the Ather Rizta. A test ride quickly converted him and the convenience of being able to book the scooter online, via Flipkart, was a welcome bonus. After speaking with a few existing users, who shared positive service experiences, his confidence in the brand grew.

“It does feel slightly expensive,"" Asawa says, “but I don’t mind paying a bit more for better service and a reliable charging network."" While he initially suffered range anxiety, Ather’s intuitive user interface, which shows nearby charging stations and estimates whether the scooter can reach them based on its battery level, proved to be very reassuring.

Asawa also appreciates features that enhance the ride experience, like a smart dashboard that saves frequent destinations, activates only when the scooter is idle, and automatically stops interacting when in motion. The turn indicators that cancel after a turn also contribute to what he calls a “thoughtful and user-friendly design"".

Eventually, Asawa opted for the mid-range Ather Rizta Z with a 2.9 kWh battery, paying ₹144,435. For his daily 25-kilometre commute through Bengaluru traffic, a full charge comfortably lasts him up to three days.

Every feature that Asawa and thousands of other Ather riders across the country take for granted today became possible because of events that transpired on the IIT-Madras campus more than a decade ago.

In the summer of 2014, Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, a couple of fresh-faced engineers from the premier engineering institute, were in a tiny lab tinkering with battery packs for a scooter. They didn’t have a factory, a supply chain or even a working scooter; just an audacious question: Could India build a world-class electric vehicle company from scratch? No shortcuts, no Chinese kits and no import-and-assemble games. Just raw engineering, homegrown talent and the audacity to think long-term in a startup ecosystem addicted to speed and ill-suited for innovation.

A little over a decade later, Ather Energy isn’t just selling electric scooters. It’s selling proof that innovation can be commercialised in India. But the road to that proof, from prototype to showroom, was a long one paved with struggles, and a whole lot of sheetmetal welding. From a hypothesis that fixing lithium-ion batteries could help solve a key limitation in electric scooters to actually launching one, Ather Energy’s journey was shaped by trial and error.

The Bengaluru-based electric vehicle (EV) startup opened its initial public offering (IPO) for subscription on 28 April, aiming to raise around ₹2,981 crore through a fresh issue and offer-for-sale mix. In the runup to the offer, the company had slashed its IPO valuation by 44% amid global market uncertainty and reduced investor share sales.

Despite reporting a net loss of ₹1,059.7 crore in FY24, the IPO concluded on 30 April with strong all-round participation—the retail quota was booked 1.78 times while the qualified institutional buyer portion was subscribed 1.70 times. Ather is set to list on 6 May.

The IPO represents more than a capital-raising exercise by Ather. It demonstrates that hardware-intensive and R&D-driven ventures can reach commercial viability and public markets in India, in an ecosystem dominated by software successes. The company’s origins at an academic campus, and its evolution into a manufacturing-intensive enterprise, highlight the potential for deep-tech innovation emerging from Indian institutions.

Mehta, who is chief executive of Ather Energy, said that the IPO marks a coming-of-age for the company. “You just kind of get a sense the business has matured and there’s a story that public markets can appreciate,"" he told Mint.

Others agree. “Most Indian EV players are still assembling vehicles; very few are inventing,"" said Suraj Ghosh, an automobile industry analyst, adding that by building its own stack, battery management, vehicle OS, and charging network, Ather is investing in long-term defensibility. “It’s India’s closest equivalent to a ‘Tesla-esque’ ethos in the two-wheeler domain, focused on control over software, hardware and even the charging infrastructure,"" said Ghosh, who was previously director of mobility at S&P Global.

Ather’s IPO is also being seen as a bellwether moment for India’s deeptech startup ecosystem. A successful listing could serve as a signal to investors and policymakers alike that India is ready to support startups pursuing long-term and capital-intensive innovation, potentially opening doors for a new generation of founders building deeptech from first principles (fundamental concepts).

Unlike consumer apps that scale up quickly by using off-the-shelf tools, deeptech startups are built on significant scientific or engineering breakthroughs. They take on complex and long-term problems from first principles, often developing entirely new technology along the way. Ather Energy fits squarely in this category.

The EV market game

India’s two-wheeler market remains one of the largest in the world, with millions of vehicles sold annually, riding on strong demand in both urban and rural areas. Companies such as Ather Energy, Ola Electric and Hero Electric are competing with legacy auto companies for market share in this rapidly growing segment, while navigating the challenges of infrastructure development, battery technology and supply chain logistics.

View Full Image India’s two-wheeler market is one of the largest in the world.

In recent years, Ather Energy has solidified its position in the market, expanding its lineup with models such as the Ather 450X, 450S and the family-oriented Rizta, launched last year. The company has also established over 175 experience centres across 96 cities in India and developed Ather Grid, a proprietary fast-charging network with more than 1,000 charging points in over 80 cities.

In 2024, India’s electric vehicle market experienced significant growth, with total registrations reaching approximately 1.9 million units, a 19% increase over 2023.

While that rising tide has lifted all boats, in terms of market share, Ather has a long way to go. It still trails Ola Electric, which was the leader in the EV two-wheeler space till March, and TVS Motor, which pipped Bhavish Aggarwal’s beleaguered company to the top spot in April this year. In the nine months ending December 2024, Ola Electric held a 34.1% market share, followed by TVS Motor (19.4%) and Bajaj Auto (18.1%). Ather Energy was fourth with 10.7%.

Mehta says that Ather’s more mass-market product Rizta, launched last year, has gained retail momentum in states such as Gujarat and Telangana, pushing market share beyond the 20% mark in some areas.

This uptick reflects a broader shift in Indian consumer behaviour, Mehta argued, where rising aspirations are fuelling “a massive premiumization"" in the two-wheeler segment.

“70% of Indian households already own a two-wheeler,"" he said. “When they come back into the market, they’re looking to upgrade. The focus isn’t just on basic utility anymore. It’s on features, experience and value.""

How Ather did it

When Ather Energy set out to build an electric two-wheeler company, it didn’t have a playbook. But the company was able to put together a team of engineers who treated prototyping like second nature. A frugal but functional testing setup and a few lucky breaks worked in their favour, recalled Mehta.

“If you were to do this outside India, particularly in the US, starting salaries would be at least four times higher,"" he said. This affordability made it possible to build deep in-house engineering muscle without burning through venture-sized budgets.

‘If you were to do this outside India, starting salaries would be at least four times higher.’ — Tarun Mehta

The company leaned heavily on the energy and knowledge of engineering students who had experience designing, building and racing their own vehicles in college. These weren’t just classroom engineers. The idea of working on a high-performance EV platform, while being paid to do what they loved in college, was an easy sell.

“These folks had good experience getting body panels done, working with fibre reinforced polymer, sheet metal, aluminum welding,"" Mehta recalled. This community became Ather’s founding talent network.

The prototyping process was equally hands-on. “I knew this fabricator in Chennai, 30 kilometers away. I would take my bike in the morning with steel parts, go sit there the entire day and he would machine them out,"" Mehta remembered. This kind of personal, on-ground involvement allowed Ather to iterate faster and stay frugal.

At a time when India lacked a mature EV ecosystem, Mehta and his cofounder and IITM batchmate Swapnil Jain saw the battery as a core constraint in EV adoption, which led them to build a scooter from scratch. With few local vendors and no existing template, they ended up designing most components in-house, often because there was no one else to do it.

They weren’t trained in structured hardware development. So, they figured it out by building prototypes and running long road tests.

Once the product came together, scaling up brought a new set of challenges. Used to solving engineering problems, Mehta and Jain initially tried to outsource manufacturing, assuming it would free them to focus on design.

“We looked everywhere to try and onboard a manufacturing partner to whom we could off-load the actual job of building vehicles (the Apple approach). It did not work. It never could,"" Mehta wrote in a blog post, reflecting on what became a turning point in 2019.

Ather then decided to go for in-house production. In 2021, the company started a manufacturing facility in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, with an annual capacity of 110,000 scooters and 120,000 battery packs. That year, it reduced assembly costs and established more stable relationships with suppliers.

In the absence of a playbook or success story, the metrics of a hardware intensive startup, without hockey-stick revenue growth or a clear path to scale, didn’t make sense for traditional venture capitalists (VCs). Mehta counted this as a blessing in disguise.

“Deeptech doesn’t move at SaaS speed. And the only reason we got the time and space was because we were funded by people who weren’t asking those questions,"" Mehta said. “We were never worried others would do it faster. Our biggest moat was very hard work. There’s a finite pool of people who can do it.""

Over the years, Ather Energy did manage to get some funding, raising approximately $450 million. Hero MotoCorp was its biggest backer, for a stake of approximately 40%. Other key investors include the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) with a 16.9% stake, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC (through Caladium Investment) with 15.04%. Mehta and Jain each own 6.63% of the company. Early investor Sachin Bansal, who had invested nearly ₹400 crore in Ather since 2014, exited last June by selling his 7.5% stake to Hero MotoCorp (2.2%) and Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath (5.3%).

But money alone isn’t enough for success, as the startup world will readily attest today. “Startups need nurturing, not just capital,"" said Ashok Jhunjhunwala, president of IIT Madras Research Park, which incubated Ather. “Young founders need years of mentorship. Without that, easy money can do harm."" He cited Ather as a case study in perseverance.

“They didn’t take shortcuts. They designed, developed and built from scratch. That’s the kind of hard work we must value,"" Jhunjhunwala said.

Innovating from within

Mehta’s ambition to build a world-class EV company is reflected in Ather’s engineering-first culture. Along with co-founder Jain, he has fostered an environment where engineers are encouraged to experiment, take ownership and innovate without fear—traits often missing in India’s assembly-focused manufacturing landscape.

This culture is also central to Ather’s global play. Competing beyond India requires not just good products, but defensible innovation, said Mehta. That’s why Ather has made intellectual property a strategic priority by filing patents across its battery management systems, vehicle OS and charging infrastructure to future-proof its platform in the global market.

Ather’s emphasis on patents is both bold and strategic, argued Ghosh. “In a world heading toward connected, updatable vehicles, owning IP is akin to owning future revenue. Indian startups rarely think this long-term, so Ather’s approach could become a case study if executed right,"" he said.

The company established a ‘patent wall’, where employees could display their contributions, reinforcing that filing patents wasn’t a daunting task, but rather a natural part of the company culture.

“India is going to be the largest exporter of two-wheelers in the new world of electric two-wheelers,"" said Mehta. “If you ever hope to become really dominant in industries with exports, you need your IP all around you.""

Faster or better?

One of the core challenges of building deep-tech innovation in India is the highly cost-conscious and tough-to-crack market. “Unlike Ola Electric’s blitz-scaling or TVS’s distribution might, Ather’s strength lies in building a high-trust, tech-savvy brand,"" said Ghosh. The real question is whether India will reward engineering-first companies in the long run or continue chasing cost-first growth.

The company has earmarked the proceeds of the IPO primarily for capacity expansion, R&D and marketing, with one-third of the capital going toward expanding a new manufacturing facility in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, for future product lines.

One of the core challenges of building deep-tech innovation in India is the highly cost-conscious and tough-to-crack market. The real question is whether India will reward engineering-first companies in the long run.

Mehta said that the company has managed to carve out a meaningful revenue stream by selling its software as a one-time accessory, separate from the vehicle. “In FY25, year to date, 6% of our revenue came from software sales and that’s a 53% Ebitda margin product,"" he said. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation.

Despite concerns that the broader consumer base might not pay for add-on software, 86% of scooter buyers in FY25 opted in. According to Mehta, this strategy is rare in Indian auto markets and reflects the growing appetite for connected and intelligent vehicles.

While Ather owns almost none of its stores, it maintains tight control over the customer experience by insisting that franchise partners bundle retail and service at every location. “You can’t just take a storefront,"" Mehta said. “You have to open service alongside sales, or it doesn’t work for us.""

This disciplined rollout model ensures that Ather’s quality ethos isn’t compromised, even as it gears up to expand from 260 to potentially thousands of touchpoints in the coming years.

In many ways then, Ather Energy’s journey offers a quiet counter to the idea that deeptech is impossible in India. Mehta and Jain have shown that it isn’t impossible. It’s just hard.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/ather-energy-ipo-ola-electric-vehicle-scooter-deeptech-ev-two-wheeler-market-startup-hero-motocorp-tarun-mehta-11746451437091.html,2025-05-05 20:13:41+05:30
Techreport.com,Huawei’s 910C AI Chips Are Ready for Mass Distribution. A Wake up Call for the US,,"Key Takeaways Mass shipment of Huawei’s 910C GPUs is expected to start by the end of this month.

The 910C uses two 910B processors and is reportedly as fast as Nvidia’s H100.

The company is also testing its latest Ascend 910D chips.

Huawei’s 910C GPU may start mass shipments by the end of May. The 910C chip can be described as more of an architectural breakthrough than a technological victory. It combines two 910B processors to achieve double its predecessor’s computing power and memory capacity.

More interestingly, and something that should be concerning for the US, is that the 910C claims to achieve the same level of performance as Nvidia’s H100, which came out in 2022.

The US has now, for years, been trying to restrict the access of AI-ready chips to China through various restrictions. The H100 is also banned from export to China. However, it has taken China just three years to catch up with Nvidia.

You can argue that China is still three years behind the US. However, it’s important to understand that the difference is closing down rather rapidly, and China is not too far behind. The US’s bans have only boosted domestic production of AI chips in China, with companies like Huawei, Moore Threads, and Iluvatar CoreX at the forefront of innovation.

What’s more, China is already testing the new Ascend 910D chip, which will reportedly be more powerful than the H100. So, America’s plan to cut China off from the AI race doesn’t look like it’s working. If anything, it’s motivating Chinese firms to accelerate growth in the semiconductor industry.

The US May Have Dug Itself a Hole

The Biden-sanctioned AI diffusion rule is set to come into force on May 15. This will restrict the export of advanced AI chips to countries around the world by dividing them into various tiers.

Where the US and its allies can have exclusive access to the latest AI tech, countries like China have been banned from importing these semiconductors. Other countries in tier 2 will only be able to import these chips up to a certain limit. This has been done so that China cannot get its hands on US-made AI chips. However, in doing so, the US may have dug itself a big hole.

Apart from directly restricting China, the rule also places caps on other countries that the US suspects may export these chips to China, thereby placing an indirect export restriction. However, it’s not difficult to see that this may turn out to be counterproductive.

As mentioned earlier, China can now produce Nvidia-comparable AI chips. So, countries needing them will import them from China instead of the US. Not only has this killed the huge Chinese market for US companies, but it has also sabotaged other global markets for them.

Imagine a scenario where no such restrictions were placed and the entire global market could freely choose between advanced chips from Nvidia, AMD, and those from Chinese companies. Buyers who preferred a higher-quality chip would’ve chosen Nvidia, while those a bit budget-conscious may have gone with AMD.

However, now that there are strict restrictions on who can get what, these countries will have no choice but to go for Huawei (or other Chinese manufacturers’ chips), which opens a whole new market for China.

China’s AI growth could have been restricted with fair competition as well, given that the US tech giants are ahead regarding technology access and innovation.

Chinese Cars and DeepSeek

You don’t have to look too far behind to see what China is capable of. It has grown tremendously in the automatic cars segment in the last 5 years. For instance, the BYD Seal is often compared to the Tesla Model 3 and can go from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds.

Similarly, the NIO ET7/ET5 models are comparable to the Tesla Model S (ET7) and Tesla Model 3 (ET5), respectively, with a range of up to 1,000 km and autonomous driving features. DeepSeek is another fabulous example. China built an AI model as good as ChatGPT and Gemini at an astonishingly low price. Simply put, China isn’t one to procrastinate on innovation.

The question, therefore, is whether the US can really ‘afford’ to cut China off in the AI-tech race. Everything we mentioned above suggests otherwise.

It’s just a matter of time before China develops its own version of Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture and its B100 and B200 AI chips. And unlike the US, China won’t close down its markets for the world. This essentially means that the country can become the next powerhouse of AI chips, which is something that would hurt the US big time.

Livemint,What big tech earnings taught us—and didn’t—about tariffs,,"Six of the Magnificent Seven have reported their financial results this earnings season, giving investors some much-needed insight into how the world’s largest tech companies are being impacted by tariffs.

Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Apple have all reported earnings over the last two weeks, making Nvidia the only Mag Seven company left.

Heading into earnings season, the tariffs put in place by the Trump administration raised concerns that companies would increase their prices to offset the levies, leading to a pullback of consumer and enterprise spending—and a potential recession.

So far, the results have only told Wall Street that tech “companies are just as confused as everybody else,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Barron’s.

“Most of them are having a difficult time parsing out how tariffs will affect them, partially because it’s a moving target,"" he added. “They don’t necessarily know how it’s all gonna end.""

Apple gave the clearest insights into how it could be impacted. CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call Thursday that the company expects to take a $900 million hit from tariffs for the June quarter.

Meanwhile, Amazon, another massive consumer-facing brand, said it is closely monitoring the effect of tariffs, while doing “everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense.""

Tesla withheld second-quarter guidance as the company measures the “impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains.""

The rest of the Mag Seven was mostly quiet on the topic, with Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft providing better-than-expected guidance with mentions of macro uncertainty.

One trend has emerged, however—a slowdown in ad spending. Alphabet and Meta are starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back budgets since the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption. That exemption previously allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs.

Chinese companies Shein and Temu—known for their low priced items—may not want to put as much money into advertising if consumers stop spending because of price increases.

But while advertising strength is now in question, software remains a haven for tech investors. Enterprises are still spending on artificial intelligence powered software meant to lower costs and increase productivity down the line.

“It’s pretty clear where the tariffs can be applied on real world goods. But, when it comes to services—and a lot of these big software companies are moving more towards software as a service—they’re not as exposed to tariffs,"" Sosnick said.

For the most part, investors can breathe a sigh of relief that tech companies remain on solid ground. But as trade policy continues to evolve, it’s clear uncertainty will be sticking around.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/what-big-tech-earnings-taught-us-and-didn-t-about-tariffs-11746453617057.html,2025-05-05 19:36:11+05:30

Tesla has seen a sharp decline in sales in key European markets, with electric vehicle registrations dropping by up to 81% in six major markets in April, compared to the same month last year.

Car registration figures for France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Portugal, and Denmark, revealed double-digit declines for Tesla sales, Reuters reported.

Many of these are high-income countries with robust charging infrastructure — typically fertile ground for Tesla.

Sales fell by 59% year-on-year in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 50% in Switzerland, 33% in Portugal, and 67% in Denmark.

The main exceptions were Norway and Italy, which respectively saw a 12% and 29% increase in Tesla sales compared to April 2024, registration data from the Norwegian Road Federation and Italian Transport Ministry showed.

However, Italian sales were still down an overall 4% in the first four months of 2025, per the Transport Ministry.

Why the two countries didn't follow a similar pattern of decline was unclear, and the overall trend suggests a significant drop-off in crucial markets.

This could partly be attributed to political tensions tied to Elon Musk's divisive role in the Trump administration and advocacy for right-wing European parties.

The ""Tesla Takedown"" movement arose earlier this year after Musk voiced support for parties including Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany.

So far this year, two Tesla sites, including the vehicles there, were defaced with orange paint in the Swedish cities of Stockholm and Malmö, as well as the Tesla branch in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Demonstrations against Musk and Tesla were held across cities in the Netherlands, and protestors also gathered outside Tesla showrooms in Portugal and Denmark. A further 12 Teslas were set on fire in Toulouse, France.

Alongside resistance to Musk and his politics, the Tesla drop-off in Europe could linked to growing competition in the EV market, notably from Chinese firms.

Tesla's aging model lineup has struggled to match newer EVs from rivals like China's BYD, whose models feature cutting-edge charging speeds and lower prices.

Professor Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, told the BBC News in March: ""We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.""

In a 2011 interview with Bloomberg, Musk rejected the possibility of BYD becoming a viable competitor.

But last year, BYD reported $107 billion in revenue, compared to Tesla's $98 billion. It also reported its first-quarter earnings increased 100% compared to the same period last year.

BYD has rolled out 1,000 kW chargers that are four times more powerful than Tesla's current chargers. These chargers, it says, can add 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes of charging.

The Tesla rival has also aggressively expanded outside China in recent years.

Tesla's dominance in Europe is waning — and reversing the trend may be Musk's toughest challenge yet.

TechCrunch,Tesla sales continue to slump across Europe despite April EV sales swell,,"Tesla’s new car sales in Spain fell 36% in April to just 571 vehicles year-over-year, Reuters reports. That slump comes as sales of electric cars made by other brands rose in the Iberian country.

Tesla sales in Spain mirror those in Europe generally, which plunged in the first four months of the year by 37.2%, even as sales of fully electric vehicles rose 28% on the continent. Some countries saw steeper losses than others. For example, Sweden’s Tesla sales dropped 81% to their lowest level in nearly three years.

Tesla’s poor sales outcome in Europe come as some buyers protest CEO Elon Musk’s swing into right-wing politics and closeness with President Donald Trump, whose tariffs have resulted in global economic instability. Europeans are also increasingly buying more Chinese EVs, including those from Tesla rival BYD.

Tesla sales have also dropped in the U.S., resulting in soft demand for the automaker’s new Model Y, according to Electrek. Tesla has begun offering discounts on the new model that was meant to re-spark weakening demand.

In a search for new markets, the automaker has recently pushed into Saudi Arabia and has begun testing the waters in India, despite a lack of charging infrastructure in the two countries.

Wccftech,Goldman Sachs Is ‘Meh’ On Tesla’s Self Driving Software As It Sticks With Neutral Rating,,"Investment bank Goldman Sachs is out with a fresh analyst note for Tesla, which takes a look at the firm's full self-driving (FSD) assisted driving platform and the expectations surrounding it for the US and Chinese markets. FSD is a key part of Tesla's valuation, and Goldman believes that the software will perform better in the US than in China. The bank has reached this conclusion as Tesla has had more time to refine FSD in the US while it launched FSD in China with little data to train the software on.

Goldman Sachs Sticks With Neutral Rating & $235 Share Price Target For Tesla

Tesla's stock has been on an upward trend lately, having gained 20% over the past month and 23% since the firm's earnings report, where Elon Musk indicated that he would devote less time to his government work and more to the firm. At Tesla's earnings call, management shared quite a lot of details about FSD. Tesla's VP of AI Software, Ashok Elluswamy, revealed that the firm had deployed FSD in China with ""very minimal data"" specific to the country, but it was still performing well.

Musk shared that his firm was focusing on safety before deploying FSD in the US. The Tesla CEO was confident FSD would ""be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year."" In its note, Goldman Sachs comments on the differences in FSD experience in the US and China and adds that Tesla could introduce its Robotaxi service in Texas in June.

Noting that the autonomous and assisted driving markets are significantly different in the US and in China, Goldman believes that competition will play a key role in determining Tesla's success in the latter. FSD ""is one of several ADAS options for consumers in China,"" it writes and adds that the ""level of technology and cost improvement that Tesla can achieve with FSD, both absolute and relative to competitors, will be key for its longer-term economics related to autonomy in our opinion (both globally and in China).""

Goldman also believes that while Tesla's long-term goal is to offer a robotaxi service, the firm will rely on a steady hand for a rollout. This falls in line with Musk's earnings call comments, with Goldman adding that ""the cost of Tesla's vehicles could be an advantage compared to other robotaxi offerings"" in the US, provided the firm can achieve economies of scale through deployment.

The bank's comments relate to the costs of manufacturing a Tesla and incorporating the hardware necessary for level 4 autonomy. Level 4 autonomy is the ability of a vehicle to operate independently of a driver, with Goldman noting that ""per Tesla its more recent HW4 equipped vehicles have all of the hardware needed for L4.""

As for China and FSD, Goldman believes Tesla ""would be facing a different competitive landscape with several AVs having attractive costs."" To overcome the competitive landscape, ""technology development, scale/cost, and regulatory approvals"" will be key for Tesla's success, it adds.",https://wccftech.com/goldman-sachs-is-meh-on-teslas-self-driving-software-as-it-sticks-with-neutral-rating/,2025-05-06 10:20:51+00:00
WBRZ,"Tesla hit following fair, owners believe crash was politically motivated",,"Tesla hit following fair, owners believe crash was politically motivated

BATON ROUGE - One family is looking for a driver who hit their Tesla after a church fair on Saturday night, believing the incident to be politically motivated.

Tesla owner Jose Mendoza said his family was making their way back to the car after an evening at the Mercy Fair. Their car, a blue Tesla, sat alone with few other vehicles in the parking lot.

""I was approaching my car when I saw a Jeep near my car, really didn't think too much of it. Then, I saw it back up,"" Mendoza said.

Seen in security video, the red Jeep drove past the blue car before stopping and backing up. The Jeep in the video paused once more before reversing and hitting the Tesla. Mendoza said he ran after the Jeep, but was unable to get clear pictures of the license plate.

Watching the video, Mendoza said the hit looked intentional and he believes the car may have been targeted because it was a Tesla.

""You know, the only thing I can think of is maybe the political climate. I mean, at this time, I can't think of any other reason why someone would do that,"" Mendoza said.

In March, the Internet Crime Complaint Center released a PSA saying the FBI is recommending Tesla owners exercise vigilance as the cars and dealerships were being targeted. The PSA said nine different states reported incidents including arson, gunfire and vandalism.

""Just be on your guard 24/7, you never know. This was just after a fair, and you know? We were just having a good time. There were really no red flags,"" Mendoza said.

WBRZ reached out to BRPD who did not comment on this particular incident but did say that the department has not seen an increase in crime targeting Tesla vehicles.",https://www.wbrz.com/news/tesla-hit-following-fair-owners-believe-crash-was-politically-motivated,

Vancouver Is Awesome,Should Eby's ‘Buy Canadian’ ethos apply to politicians' investment portfolios?,,"Some B.C. MLAs may still own Tesla stock as province cancels Tesla charger rebates

In response to U.S. tariffs, members of the BC NDP caucus, led by B.C. Premier David Eby, have been “elbows up,” imploring British Columbians to take a “Team Canada” approach by supporting B.C. businesses and buying Canadian products.

But their stock portfolios, last disclosed in 2024, may indicate their commitment to “Team Canada” doesn’t extend to assets and investments.

Of the 30 re-elected NDP MLAs who have 2024 disclosures available through B.C.’s Conflict of Interest Commissioner, only five have disclosures that clearly indicate that U.S. equities are not part of their disclosed assets. All of the other members have disclosed a mix of portfolios that include U.S. equities, and of those, a number hold strictly U.S. equity portfolios, if not individual U.S. stocks via trading accounts.

In March, Eby barred U.S. liquor from entering the province through its government-controlled distribution warehouses, and this month he ordered government ministries, health authorities and core Crown corporations to review all contracts with U.S. companies, to “decrease the province’s dependence on goods and services from U.S. suppliers.”

Those measures will arguably cost B.C. consumers directly or indirectly.

Chairing the government’s tariff response committee since January 29 has been Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs Ravi Kahlon, MLA for Delta North.

BIV asked Kahlon what his logic was behind his caucus’ suggestion to buy B.C. or Canadian products.

By way of example, he spoke to cucumbers.

“Cucumbers are just being produced right now in our greenhouses. They’re going to be coming on the market. You buy a local cucumber, you’re supporting a local company. So I think there’s a real benefit in that,” said Kahlon.

BIV asked Kahlon if that same principle should apply to investing in Canadian companies as opposed to American ones.

“I don’t give anyone advice on what investments they want to make,” said Kahlon. “But what I would say is, you know, we encourage people to invest their dollars locally.”

Kahlon discloses an unspecific “Clarington investment ethical fund” and told BIV it’s managed through Vancity.

The fund is a mix of equities and fixed income. Should Kahlon’s fund include global equities, it’s understood they would be derived from the IA Clarington Inhance Global Equity SRI (Social Responsibility Investing) Class, which holds 68 per cent U.S. equities, with Microsoft, Visa, Amazon and Apple being among the more notable top holdings.

Meanwhile, high-profile cabinet ministers Bowinn Ma, Josie Osborne, Adrian Dix and Jennifer Whiteside all own U.S. equity portfolios or portfolios heavily invested in U.S. companies.

Eby’s assets are unclear to the public. He lists a “hold mail account” whereby trading is administered by an investment advisor. According to the disclosure, the contents of the portfolio are “not disclosed to member.”

Eby did not respond to a request for comment on the topic.

In March, Eby pulled Tesla charger rebates, ostensibly on principled grounds.

“Yeah, it’s just for Tesla, and it’s because of Elon Musk,” Eby said at the time.

Eby’s Minister of Mining and Critical Minerals Jagrup Brar, Minister of State for Trade Rick Glumac and Minister of Finance Brenda Bailey all disclosed holding Tesla shares in 2024. Nelson-Creston MLA Brittny Anderson list owning shares of Ark Innovation ETF, 11 per cent of which is Tesla shares.

Bailey also declined an opportunity to comment but a spokesperson told BIV via email that she had sold her Tesla shares. The Minister's stocks were sold, and the change reported to the commissioner, in January 2025, the spokesperson told BIV April 23.

BIV reached out to the other members to confirm whether they continue to own shares in Tesla. A representative for Glumac said he no longer holds shares in the company; no other responses were received by press time. BIV also asked Kahlon about investing in Tesla.

“I would say that everyone should look at where their investments are going, and in particular, Tesla,” Kahlon said. “If you’re investing in Tesla with what’s happening there, you should be thinking twice about it.”

University of British Columbia political scientist Stewart Prest said silence from politicians on their investment portfolios aligns with a general pattern.

“We are much more comfortable talking about income and expenditures than wealth and investments,” he said.

Prest said there is no suggestion of a conflict of interest, but that it is useful to ask where people are putting their money, particularly if they are urging others to make potentially costly decisions in support of a cause. He added that there seems to be “a lack of personal commitment to match the political message” when it comes to caucus leaders’ investments.

Despite having opened a new legislature session in February, MLA disclosures for 2025 have yet to be collected and processed by the commissioner’s office.

The office told BIV it expects to send those disclosures to the clerk’s office in May.

When asked about the fact that laws are being made by new MLAs without new disclosures, Prest said that as long as the commissioner is meeting legislated deadlines, the only problem may be optics.

The Globe and Mail,Europeans continue to shun Tesla as EV maker’s April sales plunge,,"Open this photo in gallery: The Tesla logo on a car in Brussels, Belgium, on April 24.Yves Herman/Reuters

Tesla Inc.‘s TSLA-Q sales plunged across Europe in April, including an 81-per-cent drop in Sweden to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years, data showed on Friday, as Europeans buy more Chinese EVs and some protest against chief executive Elon Musk’s political views.

The automaker’s sales have dropped for four straight months across much of Europe. For the first quarter, sales of all fully electric cars rose 28 per cent in Europe while Tesla’s sales slumped 37.2 per cent.

In Sweden, Tesla’s new car sales in April plunged 80.7 per cent to their lowest since October, 2022. Its sales in the Netherlands fell 73.8 per cent to their weakest for that month since 2022 and were down 33 per cent in Portugal, a bigger drop than the previous month.

Sales in Denmark dropped 67.2 per cent, data showed on Thursday, while France reported a 59.4-per-cent fall.

The figures will increase doubts about whether the launch of a revamped Model Y in some countries can revive Tesla’s fortunes in Europe.

Car buyers can already order a new Model Y across much of Europe, but Tesla’s websites in Germany, Britain, France and Italy all say estimated deliveries will start in June. It will take a couple of months before sales data show if the updated version of the car has won back consumers.

Meanwhile, the group is offering car loan discounts and other financial incentives for new purchases of its existing models in Norway, Sweden, Germany and Britain, in a bid to drum up demand.

Tesla is battling increased competition from traditional automaker rivals, while new Chinese entrants are launching new and often cheaper EVs.

“Tesla’s technological lead has largely been eroded with the current model lineup,” said Andy Leyland, co-founder of supply chain specialist SC Insights. “Competition from both legacy auto and Chinese entrants will be weighing on sales.”

Mr. Musk, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has been involved in the Department of Government Efficiency, leading efforts to cut federal jobs. But he said last week he would cut back on the time he devotes to the Trump administration and spend more time running Tesla.

The company’s first-quarter auto revenue slumped by a fifth, and net profit plunged 71 per cent, both missing Wall Street estimates.

On Thursday, its chair Robyn Denholm denied a Wall Street Journal report that board members were looking for a new CEO.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Mr. Musk’s embrace of far-right politics in Europe has led to protests against the billionaire CEO and the company, as well as vandalism at its showrooms and charging stations across the U.S. and Europe.

“The brand has taken a reputational hit here in Europe,” said Electrifying.com CEO Ginny Buckley, adding that 59 per cent of respondents said that Mr. Musk had made them less likely to buy a Tesla, in a survey of 1,642 people between March 24 and April 11.

The brand sold 203 vehicles in Sweden in April, data from Mobility Sweden showed.

In the Netherlands, it sold 382 cars in April, based on data released by car industry bodies BOVAG, RAI Vereniging and RDC.

Tesla’s sales in Portugal were down to 302 vehicles in April, industry association ACAP said, while sales in Norway rose by 11.8 per cent to 976 cars, based on Norwegian Road Federation data.

Tesla sold 28.2 per cent fewer cars in March in Europe, based on data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association published last month.

In the same period, its Chinese competitors BYD, Chery and SAIC recorded increases of 223 per cent, 2,467 per cent and 4 per cent respectively in combined sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the EU, data released on Friday by research firm Rho Motion showed.

Other European countries, including Italy, will release April car sales data on Friday.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-tesla-sales-in-key-european-markets-plunge-in-april/,2025-05-02 07:24:33-04:00
