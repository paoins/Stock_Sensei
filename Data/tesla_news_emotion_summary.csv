Yahoo Entertainment,Ford says its Q1 profit fell by two-thirds and it expects a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year,,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) Ford Motor Co. says it expects to take a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year and is withdrawing its full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's evolving trade policy. Ford said Monday that its net income fell by about two-thirds in the first quarter to $473 million, or 12 cents per share, from $1.33 billion, or 33 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue dropped 5% to $40.66 billion. The results topped the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet, who forecast earnings per share for the quarter would be flat. Revenue was forecast to be $38.02 billion. Still, the stock fell more than 2% in after-hours trading. Last week, General Motors said it is bracing for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. Ford and Tesla are expected to see a smaller impact from tariffs than GM and other automakers because they assemble more of their cars in the U.S. Still, what impact they do see won't be insignificant. Ford originally forecast 2025 earnings before interest and taxes in a range of $7 billion to $8.5 billion, but on Monday the company said the risks associated with tariffs make updating full year guidance challenging right now given the potential range of outcomes. Ford CEO Jim Farley has been touting the advantage that higher domestic production gives his company and he did so again Monday, while acknowledging that the shake-up to the industry from tariffs is still in its early stages. Its too early to gauge the related market dynamics, including the potential industrywide supply chain disruptions, said Farley said on an earnings call with analysts. Automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage, and, boy, that is that true for Ford. It puts us in the pole position. President Donald Trump says one goal of his trade policy is to move more manufacturing of products such as autos back to the U.S. Last week Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in a move the president said would allow automakers more time to transition their manufacturing operations. Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide. The potential impact of tariffs dominated Ford's earnings calls, with one executive noting how just a little trouble with a few parts could have a dramatic effect. The rare earth materials from China, for example, how they are imported, not just for us, but for the entire industry, has become rather complicated over the last few weeks, said Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra. It would take only a few parts to potentially cause some disruption into our production.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-says-q1-profit-fell-223419913.html,,sadness,"Ford Motor Co. says it expects to take a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs.

But while the overall market is soft, EV sales have picked up sharply in New Zealand so far this year, in part because of keenly-priced Chinese brands, including the Geely-owned Polestar and BYD. April sales figures released by the Motor Industry Association (MIA) show 494 battery electric vehicle new registrations for the month, compared with 279 for April 2024 and 2316 year-to-date compared with 1499 at this point last year.

Musk pulls back The firm has faced global protests and seen vandal attacks including in Auckland in the wake of Musk donating more than US$250m ($418m) to Donald Trumps presidential campaign then spearheading the returning Presidents Doge cost-cutting drive. Another factor was some customers waiting for the refreshed 2025 version of the Model Y. First deliveries had been expected in April. Tesla ANZ has been approached for comment. The automaker is still offering run-out Model Ys at a $10,000 discount on its New Zealand website in a promotion that began in January. The BYD Shark 6 PHEV, On Teslas first-quarter conference call on April 22, after his firm reported a 71% fall in net profit to US$409m (after booking US$595m from other automakers who pay Tesla for carbon credits to offset their sale of conventional vehicles), Musk said he would spend less time on Doge and more at Tesla from the end of May. Tesla shares rallied after Musk announced his pending pullback from Trump and were recently trading at US$280.26. The stock hit an all-time high of US$479.86 in December as the new President prepared to take power. Recently, a rift has opened up between Musk and Trump over tariffs.

Electrek,Tesla Cybertruck inventory skyrockets to record high,,"Teslas Cybertruck inventory has skyrocketed to a new record high of more than 10,000 units. The vehicle program is in crisis. We reported at the beginning of April that Tesla ended the first quarter of 2025 with at least 2,400 Cybertrucks in new inventory available in the US. Theres no exact way to track Teslas inventory in the US, but there are ways to track Teslas Cybertruck listings. Sometimes, Tesla may have many vehicles with the exact same configuration at the same location and it will only publish a single listing for it. Therefore, Tesla might have been sitting on more Cybertruck inventory. Advertisement - scroll for more content A month later, the number of listings in the US has skyrocketed to over 10,000 Cybertrucks, according to Tesla-Info.com: This surge could be due to an actual net increase in Cybertruck inventory, but Tesla is also heavily discounting the trucks at varying rates, creating several different prices and, therefore, more listings. At an average sale price of $78,000, Tesla could have almost $800 million worth of Cybertrucks. Due to low demand, Tesla appears to have significantly slowed down Cybertruck production in recent months. Therefore, this surge is likely more about Tesla discounting the vehicles, exposing the broader US inventory, than an actual major increase in inventory due to more production. Many of the Cybertrucks in inventory were built in 2024, so they are already at least four months old. Tesla still has Foundation Series Cybertrucks in inventory, which it stopped producing in October 2024more than seven months ago. Tesla recently launched the Cybertruck RWD, but it has given up on making it with a smaller battery pack and instead removed many important features. Electreks Take This is about as bad as it gets. Over 10,000 units account for about two quarters of Teslas Cybertruck sales. It already looks like Tesla has slowed Cybertruck production down to a crawl, but I wouldnt be surprised if it pauses it soon. The hard part for Tesla is to admit defeat. The Cybertruck RWD using the same battery pack as the AWD was already a sort of admission that Tesla found the vehicle program to be too small to be worth being produced with two battery pack sizes. The automaker did the same with Model S/X when the programs volumes shrank following the launches of Model 3 and Model Y. It looks like under the current circumstances, Tesla will have issues selling more than 20,000 Cybertrucks per year in the US despite having planned production for 250,000 units.",http://electrek.co/2025/05/05/tesla-cybertruck-inventory-skyrockets-to-record-high/,2025-05-05 00:00:00,neutral,"The number of listings in the US has skyrocketed to over 10,000 Cybertrucks.

Japan Today,OpenAI reverses course and says its nonprofit will continue to control its business,,"By MATT O'BRIEN OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the business that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products. We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees. Altman and the chair of OpenAIs nonprofit board, Bret Taylor, said the board made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI. The nonprofit already has a for-profit arm, but that arm will be converted into a public benefit corporation that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission, Taylor said. OpenAIs co-founders, including Altman and Tesla CEO Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build whats known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanitys benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.

OregonLive,Maker of ChatGPT says it will remain under nonprofit control after all,,"After months spent pursuing a plan to convert itself into a for-profit business, OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the company that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products. We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.

The nonprofit already has a for-profit arm, but that arm will be converted into a public benefit corporation that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission, Taylor said. However, Taylor declined to say Monday how large of an ownership stake the nonprofit will have in the new public benefit corporation. He said in a call with reporters that the nonprofit will choose the board members of the public benefit corporation and, at first, they will likely be the same people who now sit on OpenAIs nonprofit board. Public benefit corporations were first created in Delaware in 2013 and other states have adopted the same or similar laws that require the companies to pursue not just profit but a social good. Public benefit corporations, which include Amalgamated Bank and the online education platform Coursera, need to define that social good, which can vary broadly, when they incorporate. Altman said that converting from a limited liability company to a public benefit corporation just sets up us to be a more understandable structure to do the things that a company of our scope has to do. Among the changes would be removing a cap OpenAI had placed on how much profit it could make. Theres so much more demand to use AI tools than we thought there was going to be, Altman said. Getting access to more capital will make it easier for OpenAI to pursue mergers and acquisitions and other normal things companies would do, Altman said.

However, with Trumps auto tariffs, Ford is suspending full-year guidance. Heres a breakdown of Fords Q1 2025 earnings Ford Q1 2025 earnings preview After crosstown rival General Motors cut its full-year financial guidance last week, investors are waiting to see if Ford will follow suit. Fords previous 2025 forecast called for EBIT of $7 billion to $8.5 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion. The biggest threat is Trumps new auto tariffs, which include a 25% duty on imported vehicles and many parts.

Yahoo Entertainment,Palantir (PLTR) Traders Brace for 12% Post-Earnings Swing,,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR, Financials) will report quarterly results after the market closes Monday, and traders are bracing for a major move. Options pricing implies a swing of more than 12%, which could push the stock to a new all-time high near $139or knock it back to $108. Palantir has become a standout in 2025, rising more than 60% year to date, even as the S&P 500 has slipped more than 3%. That momentum builds on its 340% surge in 2024, making it the index's best performer last year as well. Much of that strength comes from surging demand for artificial intelligence tools and a flood of government contracts. More than 40% of Palantir's fourth-quarter revenue came from U.S. federal agencies. While cost-cutting under President Trump and Elon Musk raises some uncertainty, Palantir's focus on defense and immigration tech puts it in step with the administration's priorities. The company has a pattern of delivering upside surprises. It rallied more than 20% after each of its last two earnings releases, citing strong adoption of its AI platform and revenue growth above 30%. Still, Wall Street isn't sold. Only one analyst currently rates the stock a buy, citing valuation concerns after its meteoric run. But Palantir's retail following remains loyal. According to Vanda Research, it's the third most popular stock among individual investors, trailing only Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) and Tesla (TSLA, Financials).

Freerepublic.com,Black Leftist Moves to Africa and Discovers That America Isnt So Bad After All,,"Skip to comments. Black Leftist Moves to Africa and Discovers That America Isnt So Bad After All the liberty daily ^ | Zero Hedge Posted on by NoLibZone Millions of Americans, including those among the lowest income brackets, truly have no idea how good life is for them. The grass is always greener somewhere else in the world until people actually take the plunge and move to the neighbors house only to discover its crack den. The self hatred that progressives feel over being American and living in the US is a first-world luxury that few others can afford. Most of humanity doesnt have time to dwell obsessively on their nations global image; they are too busy barely surviving. The argument often regurgitated by over-privileged activists on Reddit forums and in college classrooms is that American exceptionalism is problematic because theres nothing exceptional about America. This claim is debunked by the fact that most of the rest of the world wants to come to the US and very few people want to leave. Those that do leave are usually among the wealthiest, or, they are gullible and think they can find something better overseas. It usually doesnt go well for them. One black leftist recently figured this out after moving to Africa. She assumed she would fit right in, but now says she actually prefers dealing with American racism over the scammers, grifters and of course, the lack of snacks. Her complaints have gone viral because they expose the common leftist delusion that the US is somehow one of the worst places on Earth. They simply dont understand how lucky they are until they step outside of their echo chamber. A minimal amount of research will drudge up numerous accounts similar to this one Most black Americans simply cannot assimilate after relocating to Africa and most Americans dont do well in regions devoid of western culture. The ultra-rich are fine wherever they go, but middle class expatriats have difficult experiences. Black comedians and celebrities have been trying to warn their community for decades about this. The venerable Patrice ONeil didnt mince words on the idea of going back to Africa. When confronting the issue of racism in America, it should be noted that most of the world treats Black Americans differently. Not necessarily because of skin color but because of their cultural habits and behaviors. Perhaps what black leftists in America interpret as racism is actually cultural burnout; a national or even global acknowledgment by other groups that they are tired of dealing with all the baggage that the black American community tends to bring with them? And if this is the case, then its unlikely that there are many other places in the world that will give them the time of day the way American society does.

But his slide into politics specifically his alignment with President Trump and activities within the federal government has dragged Tesla into uncertainty. For many would-be Tesla buyers, the brand has lost its progressive luster. And while Musk has long been the face of Tesla, that link has taken a negative turn as the billionaire oversees mass layoffs and the elimination of federal programs via the Department of Government Efficiency. Teslas disappointing first-quarter earnings, which saw profits drop 71% amid weakened sales and anti-Musk sentiment, demonstrate just how much the brand has fallen out of favor. The company reported 336,681 deliveries in the first three months of 2025, down from 495,570 in Q4 2024 and 386,810 in the first quarter of last year. Thats off the back of an unimpressive 2024, which saw fewer deliveries than the year prior amid production delays and increased EV competition. For many, Musks political activities have turned Tesla into a symbolic pariah. Tesla trade-ins have hit record highs, while sales in Europe have dropped. Foreign leaders are calling for boycotts and the automakers stock price has lost about half its value since December. All the while, protesters continue to assemble outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations in an effort to accelerate the automakers brand devaluation and with it, they hope, Musks wealth. They have a certain significant public image problem thats really something we havent seen before in this industry, Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, told TechCrunch. Even one of Teslas most unwavering bulls, Dan Ives, has begged Musk to focus less on politics and more on his business or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla. And even though Musk said last month that hed take a step back from DOGE, hes not giving up on it either. To combat the effect this might have on Tesla, Musk has and likely will continue to lean on his sales pitch that Tesla isnt an automaker, its an AI company, one that will someday commercialize autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The question now is whether the Tesla brand can recover.

Electrek,Chery is deploying an army of blonde humanoid robots called Mornine to sell its cars [Video],,"If you thought Tesla or XPengs bipedal humanoid robots were a creepy glimpse into the future, wait until you see what Chinese automaker Chery Automotive is deploying. Alongside business partner AiMOGA, Chery is encouraging its dealers to purchase a Mornine robot to help sell vehicles to customers. Mornine definitely wont scare anyone away, right? Chery Automotive has been developing vehicles for nearly 30 years in China and operates under the ownership of the Wuhu municipal government, where it is headquartered. Weve previously covered several of Cherys sub-brands, including Luxeed, and Omoda. In addition to cars, Chery has become yet another automaker exploring bipedal humanoid robots. In June 2024, Chery announced a strategic partnership with AI and robotics specialist AiMOGA to develop a new humanoid robot called Mornine, promising to usher in a wholly innovative customer ecosystem service system. Less than a year later, Mornine was strutting her stuff around Cherys booth at the Shanghai Auto Show before a crowd of the blonde robots stood behind Zhang Guibing, president of Chery International, during a dealer and media event in its home city of Wuhu.

Hence, adding hair and makeup (and some surprising junk in Mornines trunk) makes things a helluva lot more creepy. You have to listen to her speak in the video below. Source: Chery Automotive Cherys Mornine robot is awesome, but gives us the creeps While Mornine is new to us, the sunglass-clad, ponytailed robot from Chery and AiMOGA has been in the public eye for about a year now. It was only during Cherys recent press events, however, that we learned how Mornine is expected to support the automaker. She(?) will be your local showroom specialist, of course! According to Chery Internationals president, the market for humanoid robots has more potential in the future than vehicles, and AiMOGA is the real future for the Chery company. Zhang said Mornine is the same price as a car, but could serve as a home assistant, or you can buy a second robot to help you at work. However, personal robots are still more science fiction with an emphasis that leans more toward fiction, so Chery wants to get the word out about its technology and the use cases it can one day provide the world. To do so, Chery is hoping to deploy the Mornine robots to vehicle showrooms to assist customers in learning more about available models (see more in the video below). Those arent just cool shades AiMOGA equipped Mornine with they house surround-view vision. Mornine also has fully flexible hands that can serve customers drinks and female-like vocal capabilities to answer vehicle questions. Zhang told the crowd of over 3,000 in Wuhu that Chery would offer a discount on Mornine to any interested customers, although that amount was not publicly revealed.

Jack Daniels whiskey beckons from the bar at British pubs. In France, Levis jeans are all about chic.But in the tumult of President Donald Trump 's trade war with Europe, many European consumers are starting to avoid US products and services in what appears to be a decisive and potentially long-term shift away from buying American, according to a new assessment by the European Central Bank In April, Trump imposed a 10% blanket tariff on America's trading partners and threatened ""reciprocal tariffs"" on many of those, including the European Union. Companies like Tesla and McDonald's are seeing customers in Europe put off by ""Made in America.""""The newly imposed US trade tariffs on European products are causing European consumers to think twice about what's in their shopping cart,"" the ECB wrote in a blog post about its research on consumer behavior. ""Consumers are very willing to actively move away from US products and services.""Europeans had already begun testing grassroots boycotts on American products, including Heinz ketchup and Lay's potato chips, shortly after Trump took office. His threats to take over Greenland, part of Denmark, energised Danes to organize no-buy campaigns on Facebook. Tesla owners in Sweden slapped ""shame"" bumper stickers on their cars to distance themselves from Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO who is one of Trump's top advisers.But Europeans' anguish over Trump's treatment of America's longtime allies has hardened as he has moved to rewire world trade with steep global tariffs, the central bank found.Trump took particular aim at the European Union, which he called ""very, very bad to us"" for not buying more from the United States, and threatened the bloc with a 20% ""reciprocal"" tariff last month. Such talk bewildered many Europeans and rattled EU leaders, who retaliated with a 25% duty on many U.S. goods.Both sides called a temporary truce after Trump abruptly reversed course and delayed tariffs until the summer. But the 10% baseline tariff is still in place, and a trans-Atlantic trade war could easily flare again.And even if a trade deal is reached, Europe's newfound wariness of its longtime ally will not easily be unwound. The ECB study found that even if a mere 5% tax were placed on American products sold in Europe, Europeans would still be inclined to shun them.What is new, the central bank said, is a ""preference"" among European consumers ""to move away from U.S. products and brands altogether,"" no matter what the cost. That was the case even for households that could bear the brunt of higher prices.""Even though they could afford more expensive U.S. products and services, they consciously choose alternatives,"" the bank said.

Washingtonspectator.org,"Americas Slide into Authoritarianism, as seen from TED 2025",,"Historians (if they exist in the future and any records of this period survive) will note this month as one where the United States slipped fully into authoritarianism. Incompetence, luck, and real leadership may yet intervene, but we have already crossed several red lines warned about by experts. At the TED conference this past week in Vancouver, British Columbia, about 1,700 multidisciplinary thinkers gathered to hear and discuss dozens of prepared talks. But the real action was among the attendees, who gathered all week in impromptu salon discussions to share their concerns about the state of the world and what can be done to change course. Here are some of the most discussed topics and themes. Its a Coup Carole Cadwalladr, a journalist who has reported on tech overreach and the rise of data-driven authoritarianism, delivered a powerful talk in which she correctly stated what many are afraid to admit: Its a coup. The purchase of an American president (and American sovereignty) by Elon Musk is unprecedented, and it appears to be advancing unabated. In her conference-opening talk, she also confronted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the theft of her intellectual property to train the companys AI systems. When TEDs Chris Anderson brought up this concern with Altman in an interview during the final conference session (with Cadwalladr applauding) Altmans response directed to her was, Clap all you want to about that. Enjoy. When Cadwalladr confronted him again privately backstage, he waved her off, citing fair use. While the TED community is comprised of a wide range of people, a broad majority of participants appeared to align with Cadwalladr, agreeing that AI companies are overreaching, and violating property laws. Shortly after the interview with Altman, Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey seemed to offer support for Altmans view, posting delete all ip law on X, with Elon Musk replying, I agree. Crossing the Rubicon into Authoritarianism In the course of just a few days, Americans have cataloged a laundry list of signs that the country has reached a tipping point into authoritarianism: SignalGate; Liberation Day tariffs; reversal of (some) tariffs (maybe); deportations to El Salvador; defiance of the Supreme Court; asserting that home growns (aka citizens) are next; taking control of Columbia University by placing it into receivership; bullying law firms to provide pro-bono services supportive of the regime; indiscriminate revocation of student visas; calling for the revocation of the broadcast license for CBS over dislike of 60 Minutes content; attempts to criminalize media figures like Norm Eisen; investigation of former Trump administration officials Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs on grounds of treason; forcing Americans to use X to interact with the Social Security administration; widespread DOGE cuts of programs and agencies without Congressional approval; decline of the dollar under pressure from tariffs and market chaos.

New York Post,Elon Musks security guards at Fort Knox Texas compound called cops on neighbor they thought was naked: report,,"High fences make bad neighbors. At least thats what those living near Elon Musks Fort Knox high-walled compound near Austin, Texas, claim including allegations that the moguls security forces called the cops on one neighbor for allegedly standing naked in the street. Paul Hemmer, a retired real estate agent and head of the neighborhood homeowners association in West Lake Hills, has been among the most vocal residents complaining about Musks alleged zoning code violations. 4 Elon Musk reportedly converted his suburban Austin mansion into his own Fort Knox. REUTERS He told the New York Times that he has been under constant surveillance from Musks security cameras, which were installed on the grounds of a property that the billionaire mogul purchased with the intention of merging with two other adjacent lots to serve as a compound for him, his 13 kids and their mothers. I call that place Fort Knox, Hemmer told the Times. Last year, Musks security team accused Hemmer of indecent behavior, alleging he was nude outside his home. Hemmer denied that he was naked and said he was on his property wearing black underwear. On another occasion, Hemmer stopped to urinate while walking his dog which Musks security surveillance captured. The cameras got me, Hemmer told the Times. Its scary they have guys sitting and watching me pee. 4 West Lake Hills, Texas is an affluent suburb of Austin not far from the banks of the Colorado River. Getty Images/iStockphoto Hemmers outrage at Musk prompted him to fly a video-equipped drone over his property in a bid to document alleged violations, the Times reported. Hemmer and other residents of an upscale cul-de-sac in West Lake Hills, an affluent suburb just west of Austin, launched a formal complaint against Musk after he moved in to their neighborhood in 2022. The worlds richest man whose portfolio of companies includes Tesla, SpaceX, X and Neuralink, purchased the $6 million, 6,900-square-foot mansion through a limited liability company. Musks arrival in the neighborhood, however, was anything but subtle as neighbors soon observed unsettling changes, the Times reported. Workers installed a towering 16-foot chain-link fence around the property significantly exceeding local height restrictions accompanied by outward-facing surveillance cameras. The fence is 10 feet higher than zoning ordinances permit, according to the Times. Traffic congestion soon became another sore point. Residents noted fleets of vehicles, particularly Teslas, routinely parked on their previously serene streets. Security personnel, identifiable by their firearm holsters, changed shifts three times daily, adding to neighborhood frustrations, according to the Times. The scale of the construction also violated at least six city ordinances, the Times reported. Musks representatives sought to retroactively gain permission for the various construction projects in and around the property, but were denied last month, according to the outlet. 4 Musk has reported",https://nypost.com/2025/05/05/business/elon-musks-security-guards-called-cops-on-neighbor-they-thought-was-naked/,2025-05-05 00:00:00,disgust,"Elon Musk reportedly converted his suburban Austin mansion into his own Fort Knox.

The memo pairs the racial and age considerations with an overall strategy to give defendants a nonincarceration option based on prosecutors individual analyses. While these factors should not be controlling, they should be part of the overall analysis, reads the memo.

It also said Dhillon will lead a comprehensive review of all policies and practices at the office that may involve the illegal consideration of race in prosecutorial decision-making. The use of racial identity in prosecutorial decisions, including whether to depart from Sentencing Guidelines, is another example of how deeply Critical Race Theory has penetrated society, Cornell law professor William A. Jacobson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Jacobson founded the Equal Protection Project, an initiative by the conservative Legal Insurrection Foundation. What once was a fringe academic theory has expanded from higher education into society, including the legal system, Jacobson said.

The Verge,"Waymo says it will add 2,000 more robotaxis into 2026",,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Waymo said it recently received its last delivery of Jaguar I-Pace SUVs, which will be retrofitted with sensors and autonomous driving technology at its factory in Arizona, before joining its robotaxi fleet. In a blog post published today, the Alphabet company said it currently has 1,500 Jaguars operating across its four main markets: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin. And it plans on adding 2,000 more vehicles into 2026, for a total fleet size of 3,500. The company recently hit an average of 250,000 paid passenger trips per week. Waymo typically doesnt like to comment on the size of its fleet, so todays announcement provides a rare glimpse into the number of robotaxis the company currently has in operation. Waymos plans to scale up comes as the company eyes Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, DC for launch in 2026. The Jaguar I-Pace has been the companys primary vehicle since Waymo retired its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans in 2023. The company had once projected it would have 20,000 I-Paces operating as robotaxis, but appears to have fallen significantly short of that goal. Waymo is also currently testing and validating two new models, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the all-electric Zeekr RT minivan, but has yet to say when they will join the fleet. Waymo assembles its robotaxis with the help of auto engineering company Magna International at a 239,000 square-foot factory in Mesa, Arizona. The companys final batch of Jaguar I-Paces will be assembled there, which should carry Waymo through to next year. And starting in 2026, Waymo will begin work on its sixth generation Waymo Driver, which will launch in the Zeekr RT. Zeekr is a subsidiary of Geely, which is one of Chinas largest automakers. The new robotaxi is being designed in Sweden (where Geely owns Swedish carmaker Volvo), adapted from Geelys all-electric five-door Zeekr. Waymo is then importing the vehicles to Arizona, where they will be outfitted with the hardware and software necessary for autonomous driving. The first test vehicles began arriving in the US last year. In order to adapt to multiple vehicle platforms, Waymo says its Mesa factory will add automated assembly lines and other efficiencies over time. And when its operating at full capacity, the company expects it will be able to churn out tens of thousands of robotaxis each year. Waymo added new processes at the end of the assembly line for passenger validation and commission to ensure each vehicle is ready to accept riders as soon as it leaves the factory. Each vehicle drives itself into service after leaving the factory, where it is ready for passenger pickups within 30 minutes, according to Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli.",https://www.theverge.com/news/661025/waymo-fleet-size-factory-arizona-jaguar-robotaxi-zeekr,2025-05-05 15:10:23+00:00,neutral,"Waymo said it recently received its last delivery of Jaguar I-Pace SUVs, which will be retrofitted with sensors and autonomous driving technology. In a blog post published today, the Alphabet company said it currently has 1,500 Jaguars operating across its four main markets: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin. And it plans on adding 2,000 more vehicles into 2026, for a total fleet size of 3,500. The company recently hit an average of 250,000 paid passenger trips per week."

Livemint,Ather Energy IPO: Can Indias Tesla for two-wheelers beat Ola Electric on the markets?,,"Bengaluru: Shubham Asawa, a consultant at a Bengaluru-based tech startup, initially planned to buy a conventional scooter. He was considering models such as the Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter. Given the widespread complaints about Ola Electrics service, he wasnt even thinking about switching to an electric vehicle. However, that changed when he spotted a billboard advertising the Ather Rizta. A test ride quickly converted him and the convenience of being able to book the scooter online, via Flipkart, was a welcome bonus. After speaking with a few existing users, who shared positive service experiences, his confidence in the brand grew. It does feel slightly expensive,"" Asawa says, but I dont mind paying a bit more for better service and a reliable charging network."" While he initially suffered range anxiety, Athers intuitive user interface, which shows nearby charging stations and estimates whether the scooter can reach them based on its battery level, proved to be very reassuring. Asawa also appreciates features that enhance the ride experience, like a smart dashboard that saves frequent destinations, activates only when the scooter is idle, and automatically stops interacting when in motion. The turn indicators that cancel after a turn also contribute to what he calls a thoughtful and user-friendly design"". Eventually, Asawa opted for the mid-range Ather Rizta Z with a 2.9 kWh battery, paying 144,435. For his daily 25-kilometre commute through Bengaluru traffic, a full charge comfortably lasts him up to three days. Every feature that Asawa and thousands of other Ather riders across the country take for granted today became possible because of events that transpired on the IIT-Madras campus more than a decade ago. In the summer of 2014, Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, a couple of fresh-faced engineers from the premier engineering institute, were in a tiny lab tinkering with battery packs for a scooter. They didnt have a factory, a supply chain or even a working scooter; just an audacious question: Could India build a world-class electric vehicle company from scratch? No shortcuts, no Chinese kits and no import-and-assemble games. Just raw engineering, homegrown talent and the audacity to think long-term in a startup ecosystem addicted to speed and ill-suited for innovation. A little over a decade later, Ather Energy isnt just selling electric scooters. Its selling proof that innovation can be commercialised in India. But the road to that proof, from prototype to showroom, was a long one paved with struggles, and a whole lot of sheetmetal welding. From a hypothesis that fixing lithium-ion batteries could help solve a key limitation in electric scooters to actually launching one, Ather Energys journey was shaped by trial and error. The Bengaluru-based electric vehicle (EV) startup opened its initial public offering (IPO) for subscription on 28 April, aiming to raise around 2,981 crore through a fresh issue and offer-for-sale mix.

Techreport.com,Huaweis 910C AI Chips Are Ready for Mass Distribution. A Wake up Call for the US,,"Key Takeaways Mass shipment of Huaweis 910C GPUs is expected to start by the end of this month. The 910C uses two 910B processors and is reportedly as fast as Nvidias H100. The company is also testing its latest Ascend 910D chips. Huaweis 910C GPU may start mass shipments by the end of May. The 910C chip can be described as more of an architectural breakthrough than a technological victory. It combines two 910B processors to achieve double its predecessors computing power and memory capacity. More interestingly, and something that should be concerning for the US, is that the 910C claims to achieve the same level of performance as Nvidias H100, which came out in 2022. The US has now, for years, been trying to restrict the access of AI-ready chips to China through various restrictions. The H100 is also banned from export to China. However, it has taken China just three years to catch up with Nvidia. You can argue that China is still three years behind the US. However, its important to understand that the difference is closing down rather rapidly, and China is not too far behind. The USs bans have only boosted domestic production of AI chips in China, with companies like Huawei, Moore Threads, and Iluvatar CoreX at the forefront of innovation. Whats more, China is already testing the new Ascend 910D chip, which will reportedly be more powerful than the H100. So, Americas plan to cut China off from the AI race doesnt look like its working. If anything, its motivating Chinese firms to accelerate growth in the semiconductor industry. The US May Have Dug Itself a Hole The Biden-sanctioned AI diffusion rule is set to come into force on May 15. This will restrict the export of advanced AI chips to countries around the world by dividing them into various tiers. Where the US and its allies can have exclusive access to the latest AI tech, countries like China have been banned from importing these semiconductors. Other countries in tier 2 will only be able to import these chips up to a certain limit. This has been done so that China cannot get its hands on US-made AI chips. However, in doing so, the US may have dug itself a big hole. Apart from directly restricting China, the rule also places caps on other countries that the US suspects may export these chips to China, thereby placing an indirect export restriction. However, its not difficult to see that this may turn out to be counterproductive. As mentioned earlier, China can now produce Nvidia-comparable AI chips. So, countries needing them will import them from China instead of the US. Not only has this killed the huge Chinese market for US companies, but it has also sabotaged other global markets for them. Imagine a scenario where no such restrictions were placed and the entire global market could freely choose between advanced chips from Nvidia, AMD, and those from Chinese companies. Buyers who preferred a higher-quality chip wouldve chosen Nvidia, while those a bit budget-conscious may have gone with A",https://techreport.com/news/huawei-910c-ai-chips-mass-distribution-us-wake-up-call/,2025-05-05 14:07:29+00:00,neutral,"Mass shipment of Huaweis 910C GPUs is expected to start by the end of this month.

Livemint,What big tech earnings taught usand didntabout tariffs,,"Six of the Magnificent Seven have reported their financial results this earnings season, giving investors some much-needed insight into how the worlds largest tech companies are being impacted by tariffs. Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Apple have all reported earnings over the last two weeks, making Nvidia the only Mag Seven company left. Heading into earnings season, the tariffs put in place by the Trump administration raised concerns that companies would increase their prices to offset the levies, leading to a pullback of consumer and enterprise spendingand a potential recession. So far, the results have only told Wall Street that tech companies are just as confused as everybody else,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Barrons. Most of them are having a difficult time parsing out how tariffs will affect them, partially because its a moving target,"" he added. They dont necessarily know how its all gonna end."" Apple gave the clearest insights into how it could be impacted. CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call Thursday that the company expects to take a $900 million hit from tariffs for the June quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon, another massive consumer-facing brand, said it is closely monitoring the effect of tariffs, while doing everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense."" Tesla withheld second-quarter guidance as the company measures the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains."" The rest of the Mag Seven was mostly quiet on the topic, with Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft providing better-than-expected guidance with mentions of macro uncertainty. One trend has emerged, howevera slowdown in ad spending. Alphabet and Meta are starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back budgets since the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption. That exemption previously allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs. Chinese companies Shein and Temuknown for their low priced itemsmay not want to put as much money into advertising if consumers stop spending because of price increases. But while advertising strength is now in question, software remains a haven for tech investors. Enterprises are still spending on artificial intelligence powered software meant to lower costs and increase productivity down the line. Its pretty clear where the tariffs can be applied on real world goods. But, when it comes to servicesand a lot of these big software companies are moving more towards software as a servicetheyre not as exposed to tariffs,"" Sosnick said. For the most part, investors can breathe a sigh of relief that tech companies remain on solid ground. But as trade policy continues to evolve, its clear uncertainty will be sticking around.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/what-big-tech-earnings-taught-us-and-didn-t-about-tariffs-11746453617057.html,2025-05-05 19:36:11+05:30,neutral,"Six of the Magnificent Seven have reported their financial results this earnings season.

Tesla has seen a sharp decline in sales in key European markets, with electric vehicle registrations dropping by up to 81% in six major markets in April, compared to the same month last year. Car registration figures for France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Portugal, and Denmark, revealed double-digit declines for Tesla sales, Reuters reported. Many of these are high-income countries with robust charging infrastructure typically fertile ground for Tesla. Sales fell by 59% year-on-year in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 50% in Switzerland, 33% in Portugal, and 67% in Denmark. The main exceptions were Norway and Italy, which respectively saw a 12% and 29% increase in Tesla sales compared to April 2024, registration data from the Norwegian Road Federation and Italian Transport Ministry showed. However, Italian sales were still down an overall 4% in the first four months of 2025, per the Transport Ministry. Why the two countries didn't follow a similar pattern of decline was unclear, and the overall trend suggests a significant drop-off in crucial markets. This could partly be attributed to political tensions tied to Elon Musk's divisive role in the Trump administration and advocacy for right-wing European parties. The ""Tesla Takedown"" movement arose earlier this year after Musk voiced support for parties including Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany. So far this year, two Tesla sites, including the vehicles there, were defaced with orange paint in the Swedish cities of Stockholm and Malm, as well as the Tesla branch in Lausanne, Switzerland. Demonstrations against Musk and Tesla were held across cities in the Netherlands, and protestors also gathered outside Tesla showrooms in Portugal and Denmark. A further 12 Teslas were set on fire in Toulouse, France. Alongside resistance to Musk and his politics, the Tesla drop-off in Europe could linked to growing competition in the EV market, notably from Chinese firms. Tesla's aging model lineup has struggled to match newer EVs from rivals like China's BYD, whose models feature cutting-edge charging speeds and lower prices. Professor Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, told the BBC News in March: ""We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.""

Wccftech,Goldman Sachs Is Meh On Teslas Self Driving Software As It Sticks With Neutral Rating,,"Investment bank Goldman Sachs is out with a fresh analyst note for Tesla, which takes a look at the firm's full self-driving (FSD) assisted driving platform and the expectations surrounding it for the US and Chinese markets. FSD is a key part of Tesla's valuation, and Goldman believes that the software will perform better in the US than in China. The bank has reached this conclusion as Tesla has had more time to refine FSD in the US while it launched FSD in China with little data to train the software on. Goldman Sachs Sticks With Neutral Rating & $235 Share Price Target For Tesla Tesla's stock has been on an upward trend lately, having gained 20% over the past month and 23% since the firm's earnings report, where Elon Musk indicated that he would devote less time to his government work and more to the firm. At Tesla's earnings call, management shared quite a lot of details about FSD. Tesla's VP of AI Software, Ashok Elluswamy, revealed that the firm had deployed FSD in China with ""very minimal data"" specific to the country, but it was still performing well. Musk shared that his firm was focusing on safety before deploying FSD in the US. The Tesla CEO was confident FSD would ""be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year."" In its note, Goldman Sachs comments on the differences in FSD experience in the US and China and adds that Tesla could introduce its Robotaxi service in Texas in June. Noting that the autonomous and assisted driving markets are significantly different in the US and in China, Goldman believes that competition will play a key role in determining Tesla's success in the latter. FSD ""is one of several ADAS options for consumers in China,"" it writes and adds that the ""level of technology and cost improvement that Tesla can achieve with FSD, both absolute and relative to competitors, will be key for its longer-term economics related to autonomy in our opinion (both globally and in China)."" Goldman also believes that while Tesla's long-term goal is to offer a robotaxi service, the firm will rely on a steady hand for a rollout. This falls in line with Musk's earnings call comments, with Goldman adding that ""the cost of Tesla's vehicles could be an advantage compared to other robotaxi offerings"" in the US, provided the firm can achieve economies of scale through deployment. The bank's comments relate to the costs of manufacturing a Tesla and incorporating the hardware necessary for level 4 autonomy. Level 4 autonomy is the ability of a vehicle to operate independently of a driver, with Goldman noting that ""per Tesla its more recent HW4 equipped vehicles have all of the hardware needed for L4."" As for China and FSD, Goldman believes Tesla ""would be facing a different competitive landscape with several AVs having attractive costs."" To overcome the competitive landscape, ""technology development, scale/cost, and regulatory approvals"" will be key for Tesla's success, it adds.",https://wccftech.com/goldman-sachs-is-meh-on-teslas-self-driving-software-as-it-sticks-with-neutral-rating/,2025-05-06 10:20:51+00:00,neutral," Goldman Sachs Sticks With Neutral Rating & $235 Share Price Target For Tesla.

WBRZ,"Tesla hit following fair, owners believe crash was politically motivated",,"Tesla hit following fair, owners believe crash was politically motivated BATON ROUGE - One family is looking for a driver who hit their Tesla after a church fair on Saturday night, believing the incident to be politically motivated. Tesla owner Jose Mendoza said his family was making their way back to the car after an evening at the Mercy Fair. Their car, a blue Tesla, sat alone with few other vehicles in the parking lot. ""I was approaching my car when I saw a Jeep near my car, really didn't think too much of it. Then, I saw it back up,"" Mendoza said. Seen in security video, the red Jeep drove past the blue car before stopping and backing up. The Jeep in the video paused once more before reversing and hitting the Tesla. Mendoza said he ran after the Jeep, but was unable to get clear pictures of the license plate. Watching the video, Mendoza said the hit looked intentional and he believes the car may have been targeted because it was a Tesla. ""You know, the only thing I can think of is maybe the political climate. I mean, at this time, I can't think of any other reason why someone would do that,"" Mendoza said. In March, the Internet Crime Complaint Center released a PSA saying the FBI is recommending Tesla owners exercise vigilance as the cars and dealerships were being targeted.

TechCrunch,Tesla sales continue to slump across Europe despite April EV sales swell,,"Teslas new car sales in Spain fell 36% in April to just 571 vehicles year-over-year, Reuters reports. That slump comes as sales of electric cars made by other brands rose in the Iberian country. Tesla sales in Spain mirror those in Europe generally, which plunged in the first four months of the year by 37.2%, even as sales of fully electric vehicles rose 28% on the continent. Some countries saw steeper losses than others. For example, Swedens Tesla sales dropped 81% to their lowest level in nearly three years. Teslas poor sales outcome in Europe come as some buyers protest CEO Elon Musks swing into right-wing politics and closeness with President Donald Trump, whose tariffs have resulted in global economic instability. Europeans are also increasingly buying more Chinese EVs, including those from Tesla rival BYD. Tesla sales have also dropped in the U.S., resulting in soft demand for the automakers new Model Y, according to Electrek. Tesla has begun offering discounts on the new model that was meant to re-spark weakening demand. In a search for new markets, the automaker has recently pushed into Saudi Arabia and has begun testing the waters in India, despite a lack of charging infrastructure in the two countries.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/tesla-sales-continue-to-slump-across-europe-despite-april-ev-sales-swell/,2025-05-05 00:00:00,sadness,"Teslas new car sales in Spain fell 36% in April to just 571 vehicles year-over-year.

Vancouver Is Awesome,Should Eby's Buy Canadian ethos apply to politicians' investment portfolios?,,"Some B.C. MLAs may still own Tesla stock as province cancels Tesla charger rebates In response to U.S. tariffs, members of the BC NDP caucus, led by B.C. Premier David Eby, have been elbows up, imploring British Columbians to take a Team Canada approach by supporting B.C. businesses and buying Canadian products. But their stock portfolios, last disclosed in 2024, may indicate their commitment to Team Canada doesnt extend to assets and investments. Of the 30 re-elected NDP MLAs who have 2024 disclosures available through B.C.s Conflict of Interest Commissioner, only five have disclosures that clearly indicate that U.S. equities are not part of their disclosed assets. All of the other members have disclosed a mix of portfolios that include U.S. equities, and of those, a number hold strictly U.S. equity portfolios, if not individual U.S. stocks via trading accounts. In March, Eby barred U.S. liquor from entering the province through its government-controlled distribution warehouses, and this month he ordered government ministries, health authorities and core Crown corporations to review all contracts with U.S. companies, to decrease the provinces dependence on goods and services from U.S. suppliers. Those measures will arguably cost B.C. consumers directly or indirectly. Chairing the governments tariff response committee since January 29 has been Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs Ravi Kahlon, MLA for Delta North. BIV asked Kahlon what his logic was behind his caucus suggestion to buy B.C. or Canadian products. By way of example, he spoke to cucumbers. Cucumbers are just being produced right now in our greenhouses. Theyre going to be coming on the market. You buy a local cucumber, youre supporting a local company. So I think theres a real benefit in that, said Kahlon. BIV asked Kahlon if that same principle should apply to investing in Canadian companies as opposed to American ones. I dont give anyone advice on what investments they want to make, said Kahlon. But what I would say is, you know, we encourage people to invest their dollars locally. Kahlon discloses an unspecific Clarington investment ethical fund and told BIV its managed through Vancity. The fund is a mix of equities and fixed income. Should Kahlons fund include global equities, its understood they would be derived from the IA Clarington Inhance Global Equity SRI (Social Responsibility Investing) Class, which holds 68 per cent U.S. equities, with Microsoft, Visa, Amazon and Apple being among the more notable top holdings. Meanwhile, high-profile cabinet ministers Bowinn Ma, Josie Osborne, Adrian Dix and Jennifer Whiteside all own U.S. equity portfolios or portfolios heavily invested in U.S. companies. Ebys assets are unclear to the public. He lists a hold mail account whereby trading is administered by an investment advisor. According to the disclosure, the contents of the portfolio are not disclosed to member. Eby did not respond to a request for comment on the topic.

The Globe and Mail,Europeans continue to shun Tesla as EV makers April sales plunge,,"Open this photo in gallery: The Tesla logo on a car in Brussels, Belgium, on April 24.Yves Herman/Reuters Tesla Inc.s TSLA-Q sales plunged across Europe in April, including an 81-per-cent drop in Sweden to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years, data showed on Friday, as Europeans buy more Chinese EVs and some protest against chief executive Elon Musks political views. The automakers sales have dropped for four straight months across much of Europe. For the first quarter, sales of all fully electric cars rose 28 per cent in Europe while Teslas sales slumped 37.2 per cent. In Sweden, Teslas new car sales in April plunged 80.7 per cent to their lowest since October, 2022. Its sales in the Netherlands fell 73.8 per cent to their weakest for that month since 2022 and were down 33 per cent in Portugal, a bigger drop than the previous month. Sales in Denmark dropped 67.2 per cent, data showed on Thursday, while France reported a 59.4-per-cent fall. The figures will increase doubts about whether the launch of a revamped Model Y in some countries can revive Teslas fortunes in Europe. Car buyers can already order a new Model Y across much of Europe, but Teslas websites in Germany, Britain, France and Italy all say estimated deliveries will start in June. It will take a couple of months before sales data show if the updated version of the car has won back consumers. Meanwhile, the group is offering car loan discounts and other financial incentives for new purchases of its existing models in Norway, Sweden, Germany and Britain, in a bid to drum up demand. Tesla is battling increased competition from traditional automaker rivals, while new Chinese entrants are launching new and often cheaper EVs. Teslas technological lead has largely been eroded with the current model lineup, said Andy Leyland, co-founder of supply chain specialist SC Insights. Competition from both legacy auto and Chinese entrants will be weighing on sales. Mr. Musk, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has been involved in the Department of Government Efficiency, leading efforts to cut federal jobs. But he said last week he would cut back on the time he devotes to the Trump administration and spend more time running Tesla. The companys first-quarter auto revenue slumped by a fifth, and net profit plunged 71 per cent, both missing Wall Street estimates. On Thursday, its chair Robyn Denholm denied a Wall Street Journal report that board members were looking for a new CEO. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Mr. Musks embrace of far-right politics in Europe has led to protests against the billionaire CEO and the company, as well as vandalism at its showrooms and charging stations across the U.S. and Europe. The brand has taken a reputational hit here in Europe, said Electrifying.com CEO Ginny Buckley, adding that 59 per cent of respondents said that Mr. Musk had made them less likely to buy a Tesla, in a survey of 1,642 people between March 24 and April 11.
