Everyone else only exists because of government protections or corporate benefactors. Two companies might be an exception to this... Google/Waymo because they seem to have mastered FSD. Ultimately they'll turn dumb cars into automated cars and that will be crazy profitable. The other company is Toyota and their hydrogen-fueled cars. It's a long shot, but if they can get hydrogen to work in terms of cost and convenience, then it will replace EVs. So Google and Toyota. Everyone else is going to go bankrupt.",
(05/1) Interesting Stocks Today - Unemployment gets Worse,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. Tariff news expected by the end of the day from the White House. News: [Weekly jobless claims surge to 241,000]( [**TSLA (Tesla)**]( Tesla chair denied reports of a search for a new CEO to replace Elon Musk, reaffirming the companys commitment to its current leadership structure. This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well. [**RBLX (Roblox)**]( Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux! [**MSFT (Microsoft)**]( EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). [**META (Meta)**]( Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level.

So how does the lowered regulation for autonomous vehicles actually help Tesla achieve a profitable autonomous taxi service?,"Ok. So what I learned finally after scouring every article out there is this. Under new AV rules: 1-reporting standard for AV involved crashes will be lowered NOT eliminated; I guess that saves Tesla a few buck every month. 2-AV vehicles can be built with less hardware (mirrors, brakes) since they dont need a driver. I guess we can lower the cost of the car a bit. So how does this warrant a 10% price move today on TSLA after prior days move after a horrible earnings report? Did everyone see less regulation titles and assume that all of a sudden Tesla cars would be driving themselves, because it was the previous regulations that was stopping Tesla from having an actual autonomous car deployed?",stocks,2025-04-26,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k7yuoj/so_how_does_the_lowered_regulation_for_autonomous/,"Who cares? There are two potential headlines that would actually matter to the Tesla story, one is Tesla robots giving really good blowjobs and hitting the stores next week and the other is the company filing for bankruptcy. Everything in between is just vibes.The reporting requirements are a tiny savings and not important. The current action that matters most is that AVs made in the US will be able to get the same exemptions that foreign made AVs have been able to get. The exemption is important because safety standards currently require things like a steering wheel and a brake pedal, which in a fully automated ride service you don't want to have... Imagine a functional steering wheel in fully automated ride service ... at bar closing on a Saturday night... someone in one of those cars is going to grab the steering wheel and override the automation system, hopefully with as little consequence as driving into a ditch and stranding it there, but possibly much worse. So those exemptions are necessary for this to be a real thing. Or you could I suppose only carry passengers in the back seat, but that seems like a waste of capacity. The other significant thing is the signalling that these are 'first steps' in the process. Duffy presents it as a 'new framework' that will make sure that we have a national AV policy, ""The new framework will unleash American ingenuity, maintain key safety standards, and prevent a harmful patchwork of state laws and regulations."" The prevailing belief has been that getting AV ride services on the road was going to be a state by state or even city by city regulatory battle. If a national regulatory framework is rolled out for permitting AVs generally and AV ride services particularly, this is enormous for Tesla, and also for Waymo. Even if the standards for being allowed on the road are very strict, it's going to be a far easier task than fighting legislative battles and complying with 50 different possibly conflicting standards. I expect there will be court challenges contesting the D.O.T.'s authority here, as well as legislation to locally prohibit AV's in areas where they are greatly mistrusted and lawsuits to challenge *that* authority. But right now the stock market is reacting to today's news not tomorrow's problems.Tesla is already getting obliterated by Waymo Seeing as Uber is already integrating Waymo vehicles into their service, Tesla is at a severe disadvantage considering they havent even brought their inferior robo-death-cab to market yet. Tesla is getting its lunch eaten by every other car company right now, is losing the robotaxi race to Waymo, and Optimus is getting its ass kicked by a variety of robotics companies, including Hyundai/Boston Dynamics. Tesla is a house of cards.By lowering the standards those that are killed or harmed by breakdowns in the system will have less of a legal standing to get their legs back.Why are people still falling for the Tesla hype machine? The regulatory changes are minimal and won't fix Tesla's fundamental FSD problems. Their autonomous tech is nowhere near ready for real robotaxis - just look at their dismal Q3 earnings and plummeting margins. The stock jump is pure market irrationality, just like when Trump's tariffs sent the whole market into chaos. Speaking of which, those tariffs absolutely crushed Tesla's margins in China, but fanboys conveniently forget about that. Tesla's FSD has been ""almost ready"" for what, 5 years now? Musk keeps moving the goalposts. The new regulations don't magically make their tech work better. They still can't handle basic driving scenarios that other companies solved years ago. The 10% jump is classic TSLA - all hype, no substance. The company reported one of its worst quarters in years with massive margin compression, but hey, Musk says he's ""focusing more on Tesla"" now so everything's fine, right? Pure delusion. Bottom line: These regulatory changes are just window dressing. Tesla needs to fix their actual technology before any of this matters. But the market doesn't care about fundamentals when it comes to TSLA.",
SPY and TSLA Flows Look Strong - But Something Feels Off Under the Hood,"Not trying to be a doomer, but after watching the action into close today, its hard to shake the feeling that something doesnt add up: SPY dark pool inflow was heavy, yeah, but the majority of the late prints were at bid, not ask. Thats smart money selling into strength, not loading for continuation. TSLA was heavily distributed at the top, despite the media pump. Price action stayed glued to gamma walls, no real organic movement past resistance. VIX dropped but didnt collapse, which is weird. If this rally was legit, VIX should've flushed much harder. Holding above 23 tells me big players are still hedged. After-hours was ""calm"", but a little too calm. No meaningful momentum, no real follow through. Its hard to call tops, Im not claiming to. But between the sell-side dark pool flow, the late-day bid prints, and VIX refusing to die, Im definitely raising an eyebrow. Just my two cents. Make sure you have a plan, not just hopium.

Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives.

Yesterday especially so: a lot of earnings reports had an inverse effect on company stocks, I have no clue how TSLA managed to skyrocket. We're still heading into a recession, but it seems like Trump's claims dictate market movements more strongly.

The buy and sell mechanics no longer exist. Previously, you'd only be able to purchase a stock if someone was willing to sell it at that price. If you want to buy a share for $20 but noone wants to sell then tough luck, offer $20.50. But now, market makers will sell you a share at $20 regardless of whether there's a seller or not and then fulfill the order at a later point if they want (just look at the sheer amount of FTDs that occur that show how often shares don't get delivered). Market makers have openly admitted they steer prices to where they think they should be - Why this doesn't have everyone going insane is beyond me as they admitted to controlling the price of stocks - We know why the industry isn't up in arms and it's because they're working it that way for themselves.

Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Teslareported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier. Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations. * **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated * **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year. Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit. Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago. Its been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEOElon Muskspending much of his time inPresident Donald Trumps White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The presidents sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment,automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells. Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday. The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update. In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. The company said this dynamic, and changing political sentiment could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products. Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germanys far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the companyreporteda 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681. Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. byAlphabetsWaymo. The company has promised to launch itsfirst driverless ride-hailing offeringin Austin, Texas, in June. The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a pilot launch in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year. Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline. The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year. Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity. Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.

I think the only thing that sends the stock soaring is if Elon uses the call to publicly announce he's stepping down from DOGE and devoting 100% of his efforts to TSLA.

Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.,"Position: I am short on Tesla. Apparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move]( We all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. Prediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming ""not-a-car-company"" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [ ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. Prediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order: 1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has ""intelligence"" and ""awareness"". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there. 2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: ""*Now watch this!*"". 3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. 4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. 5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. 6. End sham demo. 7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. I predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all ""new"" technology. Most importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any ""brand damage"" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. The whole ""Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore"" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else ""new"" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC]( Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it ""Musk"" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. Will Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 daysfrom the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before]( that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future.",stocks,2025-04-22,216,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k59c6r/tesla_earnings_two_predictions_and_what_to_watch/,"90% chance guidance is going to be all about those robots.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. News: [Trump's Trade War Puts Us Dollar Bonds Safe Haven Status At Risk]( [**TSLA (Tesla)**]( \- Tesla is set to report Q1 2025 earnings today after market close. Analysts anticipate EPS of $0.41 and revenue of $21.54B, reflecting a 13% YoY decline in deliveries to \~337K units. TSLA faces challenges from declining EV sales, brand damage, and potential impacts from new auto tariffs. I'm mainly interested in sub-$200 buys as a small reversal trade, not sure if I'll take a short position prior to earnings. Not interested in trading if the earnings are good. Risks include continued decline in deliveries, margin compression, and potential regulatory impacts from tariffs. Something else I'm interested in listening for is lessened political risk- if Elon is announcing an actual step down from DOGE then that might help the stock. [**SEDG (SolarEdge)**]( / [**FSLR (First Solar)**]( \- The U.S. has finalized tariffs up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, targeting countries like Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Most of our solar capability is imported from SE Asian countries. This move is meant to protect domestic manufacturers like SEDG and FSLR. Not too interested in this as a day trade, more as a swing trade. [**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**]( \- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties. [**JKS (JinkoSolar)**]( \- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.

"After surge to record highs, gold overtakes 'Magnificent 7' as the most crowded trade on Wall Street","[ [Gold]( surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop. According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability."" In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners. The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements. Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

I believe it will take a combination of both cameras and lidar to achieve true FSD. Dumbass, I mean musk knows this, but he is too committed to the camera system. Byd is going to slaughter Tesla. I see byd everywhere in Central and South america. Tesla not so much. Don't be fooled by all the Teslas you see in the United states. It is not like that in many other countries.

"Tesla's Stock Is Set For A ""Death Cross"" On Monday","Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high. Tesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment? Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse. The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla. Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now. The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing. Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult. Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla. What does the data tell us about Tesla's stock? Its technicals look rough If you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends. As of Friday morning, Tesla was near the ""death cross"", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal. ""Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,"" Lang said. Below is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.",stocks,2025-04-13,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jxvwyf/teslas_stock_is_set_for_a_death_cross_on_monday/,"None of it matters.

I don't need to show anyone a map to display that most cities in America are left-leaning. And everything ""Tesla"" is conspicuously Tesla. Consumers have lots of choices in getting a ride these days. Why would they pick a Cybercab over an Uber or Lyft? Lastly, Elon is terrible at math. I don't care if he is talking about saving ""trillions"" of dollars with government cuts or producing ""millions"" of Cybercabs. He is always off by orders of magnitude. I highly question his education. If he indeed earned a physics degree, he would at least be able to make projections based on reality within an order of magnitude. And he is nothing close to an engineer (I am one). His long running statement of making ""millions"" of Cybercabs is not based in reality.

To reach anything in the ""millions"", Tesla would have to capture almost the entire market share of all ride hailing services upon launch of their long delayed combined product and service. That is pure nonsense being put out into the Elon Reality Distortion Field (ERDF). Tesla would in fact lose money by making more Cybercabs than the market could possibly demand. The same concept would apply if they made a trillion cars without any buyers for them. Don't people even check the actual market potential for any of his over-inflated promises? Tesla's current ""testing"" for their Robotaxi service is just their employees riding around in their cars. It's a PR stunt more than anything else. Meanwhile, Google's Waymo is providing actual rides to actual customer in multiple cities. Elon has criticized the Waymo's design and cost, yet his Robotaxi is nowhere to be seen on the roads. He also levels this public criticism when he needs to replace something like \~4 million computers in preexisting Tesla's just to get them to meet previously promised FSD capabilities (there goes a few hundred million at least). He gets more traction for talking trash about his competitors when his own company is way behind and has nothing to show other than puffery and recalls.

Ciscos Dot Com Collapse and Dead Cat Bounce A Cautionary Tale,"I see some parallel between a company (Tesla) today (April 28th, 2025) that has reduced demand (9% total revenue decline, 20% automobile revenue decline, 71% profit decline), and unrealistic valuation (trailing P/E ratio 163, forward P/E 129, PEG 4.41) and Cisco during the Dot Com Bubble. During the dot-com crash, Ciscos stock price dropped by approximately 89% from its peak of $80.06 in March 2000 to its low of $8.12 in October 2002. The decline occurred over approximately 2.5 years, from March 2000 to October 2002. Cisco was a flagship tech stock during the dot-com bubble, fueled by speculative exuberance and overvaluation (trading at 220x earnings in 2000). The bubble burst due to unrealistic valuations, drying up of venture capital, and reduced demand for networking equipment as dot-com companies collapsed. Before the bubble burst, Cisco Systems had a significant following that could be described as cult-like among investors, analysts, and tech enthusiasts. This fervor was driven by Ciscos dominance in the networking equipment market, its skyrocketing stock price, and the broader speculative mania surrounding internet-related companies. The term cult stock (sounds familiar to meme stock?) was used in financial circles to describe companies with fervent investor bases, and Cisco fit this mold due to its perceived invulnerability and widespread ownership (it was held by many mutual funds and individual portfolios). Dead Cat Bounce During the Decline: AprilMay 2000: After an initial drop post-March 2000, Ciscos stock briefly rallied, gaining approximately 1015% over 1015 trading days, before resuming its downtrend. This was part of the broader NASDAQs temporary recovery. Early 2001: A rally following Federal Reserve rate cuts saw Ciscos stock rise by about 20% over roughly 10 trading days, but the gains were short-lived as economic fundamentals remained weak. Late 2001 to Early 2002: Another bounce occurred, with the stock climbing from around $13 to $20 over approximately 1520 trading days, before falling to its October 2002 low. Ciscos bounces were driven by temporary optimism, policy interventions, or short covering, but the overarching bear market and overvaluation prevented sustained recovery.",stocks,2025-04-29,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kafc4d/ciscos_dot_com_collapse_and_dead_cat_bounce_a/,"Elon musk probably going to say robotaxi and opitmus robot ready for max adatpation every year for 10 years.

It's more likely they would hover around $9 for years and eventually be bought by another car manufacturerI also remember this. Their stock never recovered in 25 years. The big difference between Cisco and Tesla is that Cisco was a victim of a broader market collapse (the dot-com bubble). It has always been a great company, with good products, and loyal customers. Tesla has none of these qualities and a leader that continues to sully the brand. Cisco is a case of bad things happening to good companies. Tesla is a bad company.",

Has everyone forgotten about logistics and infrastructure when talking about Tesla?,"I keep seeing how Robotaxi is the lifeline for Tesla and justification for it's stock price along with it's robots. What I don't understand is does anyone actually think if Robotaxi launches successfully it will stay a part of Tesla? It is almost guaranteed they will spin off a new company to house that part of the business to separate potential litigation and liabilities from Tesla and launch that companies own stock. Second, has anyone dived into the current energy limitations in the US and max current generation capacity? Elon talks about adding millions of self driving taxis to our cities infrastructure and roads when they are already jammed packed and over capacity. The US Energy department estimates it will add 300-400 Gigawatts of capacity to the grid by 2040. Charging 1 electric vehicle to full charge take roughly 100 kwh. 1 million new electric cars charging daily would take 100 gigawatts of capacity. From a charging stand point alone this business is not currently feasible and certainly not by 2026 as he has said. This does not even touch the logistics of liability, charging, app/software infrastructure. What happens if the app crashes or a robo bricks in the middle of the highway or gets in an accident or simply gets stuck. Am I the only one who looks at this business model and company claims and is scratching his head going how is this logistically going to work and then stay under Tesla? Disclosure: I own puts and calls on Tesla (short term).",stocks,2025-04-28,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k9x26e/has_everyone_forgotten_about_logistics_and/,"With that PE, it is absolutely a meme stock divorced from any reality.Your skepticism is sound.

Doesn't matter.Other parts of your question aside, your generation logic just doesn't math out. The robotaxis to be used have a 40-50 kWh battery. Not 100. But even if they are recharging twice a day, so driving \~450 miles, that's 100kWh per day per car. At 1M cars, that's 100GWh. Not 100 GW of capacity. 100 GWh per day is likely something on the lines of 5 to 8 GW of capacity. Add to this the plans to add solar to a ton of these charging stations, and a lot of the additional generation capacity is solved. The median estimate for drivers making money with Uber is \~$0.29 per mile (factoring in empty loads and such). Even if Tesla just does $0.20 in profits per mile and does 450 miles a day per car, that's $90 per car. More than enough money to build out additional generational capacity. Note that this does assume that they will get there and have robotaxis operating. But if they do, money is not going to be an issue.",
Big Techs Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High,">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings,Donald Trumphad just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits. >Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture. >This weeks quarterly results fromMicrosoft Corp.,Apple Inc.,Meta Platforms Inc.andAmazon.com Incwill land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war thats wiped $5.5 trillion from theS&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap. >Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isnt giving the companies estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven which also includes Google-parentAlphabet,Tesla Inc.andNvidia Corp. to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast thats barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions. >That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolsterfearsof muted corporate spending ahead. >Any modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs, saidPhil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this years weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity. >Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported itsworst quarterin years, though traders cheered signs that chief executiveElon Muskintends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabetbeat expectationsbut offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7indexjumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though its still down 15% in 2025. >A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth,wroteBloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategistGina Martin Adams. >Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoftssudden decisionto pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures. >Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analystBrent Thill. >That said, theres little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty.American Airlines Group Inc.andSkechers USA Inc.are among companies that haveabandonedforecasts this quarter. >Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters. >I think the more experienced management arent even going to try, he said. >A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. >That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trumpsaida deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs hes posted on Chinese goods. >But forKeith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio. >The valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we havent pulled the trigger yet, he said.

Do you worry about concentration risk of investing in SP500?,"7% of SP500 total market cap is just Apple. 6% of SP500 total market cap is MSFT The top 10 holdings accounts for almost 40% of the market cap and includes mostly tech names such as AMZN, GOOG, NVDA, META, TESLA.

So the question is why would you hold Apple (and similar) and SP500? You are already over exposed to Apple by buying SP500, so why add to the concentration?

Tesla Earnings: The Old Used Kleenex Trick Works Again,"Well... Tesla bulls cheered after one of the worst earnings reports in company history (maybe even *the* worst). Here is the high level takeaway from Barron's: ""*Tesla stock is surging, but make no mistake: The quarter wasnt good. The stock reaction is more of a lesson in expectations and the stock market rather than a financial one.* *Sales, operating profit, and net income fell 9%, 66%, and 39% year over year. That belies how weak the EV business is currently. From peak quarterly levels, Teslas sales are 25% lower and net income is 77% lower. First-quarter operating profit is down 90% from a fourth-quarter 2022 peak of $3.9 billion.*"" (Source: [Tesla: Just How Bad Was This Quarter?]( I keep using my facetious tech-jargony term: ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to explain how Elon can overcome even the worst news with hype. But it is a real thing! And it really works. Here is the bottom line if you are a Tesla bull: Elon can tell the markets to ignore all of 2025, plummeting sales, self-created political drama and chaos, complete lack of focus in his leadership at the company, brand damage, endless delays, failed product launches (e.g., Cybertruck), rising competition, need to replace 4M computers in their cars to get anything resembling FSD so they don't get sued (again), and losing 90% of the company's operating profit and turn it into a juicy buying opportunity. The ticker doesn't lie. The stock goes up as the profit goes down (dramatically), driving the P/E ratio even further away from reality, now approaching jaw-dropping \~150x. And the stock still going up this morning. Bulls win. Again. For those of us outside the grip of the ERDF, here is my take on the earnings: It was basically a used Kleenex being used by Elon to clean up his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (you fill in the blank in the comments- make us laugh). It was the same old news being reused to wipe away the reality of a failing and desperate company. **----End main post. Begin TLDR analysis. Don't read it if you are just going to complain----** Below is one obvious fact, three used Kleenex, and what I see priced into the stock at this time: **Fact:** Trump is indeed giving Elon the widely expected quid pro quo deal for buying him the White House. Remember the tariff ""news"" that was released right at the same time Tesla's horrid sales numbers were released a few weeks ago? Well, we got the same thing for the predictable dumpster fire of an earnings report yesterday. Trump is moving the macro elements in the markets by timing his ""tariff on/off"" switch to boost a single stock of the company owned by the person that got him elected. It's simple: Elon buys Trump the White House. Trump buys Elon more time to make is car company ""not-a-car-company"" by keeping the stock pumped. Elon is acting as a heat shield for Trump by doing the dirty work of cutting jobs with DOGE and Trump is acting as a heat shield for Tesla's stock. I bet we will see another White House sales special when the ""low cost"" car comes up for sale too. **Used Kleenex #1:** ERDF has achieved FSD mode as long as Elon keeps his hand on the wheel 2-3 days out of the week for Tesla. The news that was already known by the law mandates the term for Special Advisors to the President be limited to 130-days per calendar year, was deployed again. This same (not actual news) news release was already made and already got the stock to pop. But Elon isn't really leaving. According to the man himself, he is still going to be splitting his time between DOGE and Tesla, giving each a few days a week. And don't forget about SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, 14-kids and counting, and all the other stuff he spends his time on like gaming. But trust him: He is really going to focus this time. Seriously guys. **Used Kleenex #2:** Tesla is now going to make that low cost EV that Elon called ""silly"" and ""pointless"" just a few months ago (Source: [Elon Musk Says Making a $25,000 EV Is Silly and Pointless]( But this is not going to be a ""new"" car. This is going to be a stripped down version of a Model Y or 3 (Source: [Teslas Dirt-Cheap EV Might Just Be A Basic Model 3 Or Y]( This will allow them to use the same production lines and just strip out as much as they can as fast as they can. This is looking more like a B-52 bomber that is running on fumes while the crew is frantically throwing as much out the window to drop weight before they crash and burn. It is clearly an act of desperation. Tesla is either doing upgrades to the same cars (e.g., the Juniper) or downgrades to the same cars. Nothing new. The only ""new"" think Tesla has done is the Cybertruck, which has been one of the biggest failures in automotive history. \*FYI: There is a low cost Tesla on the market. It's called a used Tesla. And there are plenty of them available right now. **Used Kleenex #3:** More empty promises of the same late-to-market vaporware. The cars will achieve full self-driving (FSD), the Robotaxi will launch, and Optimus will take over all tasks for humans everywhere. But not really. FSD will be diluted to something you need to assist and delays will be blamed on something other than Tesla's mismanagement (e.g., George Soros, red tape, etc.). About 10-20 older model Teslas with upgraded computers will start giving rides around Austin (probably to employees only). And the Optimus, for which there is no consumer market or supply chain for, will be doing a few things for a demo reel around the Tesla factory floor. How many times can Elon use the same Kleenex before the market throws it out? Your guess is as good as mine... **Here is what is priced in:** Perfection, fruit fly brain, harder things being made easy, no risk, and no competition. The markets are signaling that Tesla management will masterfully navigate any brand damage with absolute perfection. Despite not having managed anything very well in the past, this is being seen as a complete non-issue for the company. Basically, the market is expecting all consumers to have the memory of a fruit fly and all of Elon's public chainsaw wielding insanity will blow over in a few months time. And of course, that he will not do or say anything stupid again after being unable to do so since his inception. Most importantly, no brand damage will affect any of the future products being launched this year (but not really) because consumers with the brain's of a fruit fly won't associate other Tesla products with Tesla. Makes sense right? The only new Tesla has made in the vehicle space is the Cybertruck. They used glue to attach the body panels and it fell apart, requiring a 100% recall. It has been one of the worst failures in automotive history. Doing things like FSD, integrating AI, and making humanoid robots that seamlessly work alongside humans are astronomically more challenging by comparison. And we are supposed to believe that the company still can't build a vehicle with any level of acceptable quality after decades of trying will be able to pull off much harder technical challenges in just a few months? Makes sense right? The markets are ignoring all competition and looking at Tesla as the only potential beneficiary of it's EVs and vaporware. BYD is very real in the EV space and has already taken over global sales without even having access to the US market. Toyota is about to be crushing it in the US EV market (do your own research- it's coming). They already have a low cost EV that is so popular in China it crashed their servers with so many people trying to order it (Source: [Meet Toyotas cheapest EV in China, the bZ3X]( Meanwhile, Tesla just has used Kleenex and a driving dumpster fire to offer. That little tech company known as ""Google"" already has a robotaxi service up and running in cities across America with their company Waymo. They are way ahead. There is even more competition in this space such as Zoox. And there are already tech savvy taxi services available in Uber and Lyft. People can get a cab ride pretty easy these days. This space has very heavy competition already and Tesla is way behind but they are being valued as if they will be the first and only taxi service available. Again, the markets assume there will be no brand damage here. Why will consumers pick Tesla's Cybercab over everything else? Because they like getting flicked off while being driven somewhere? Let's be honest: Nothing will make you look cooler in America's predominantly left-leaning cities than stepping out of a Tesla Cybercab to meet your friends for dinner at your favorite restaurant. You will look even cooler if you throw your buddies an ""elbowless wave"" when you get out. Tesla's robotaxi effort is being viewed as ""no-risk"" endeavor. Basically, if Tesla launches, nothing could go wrong. GM's Cruise already learned this is not the case when they launched ahead of Tesla (Source: [GMs Cruise Halts All US Robotaxi Service After Suspension for Pedestrian Who Was Dragged]( Given Tesla's track record of launching products before they are ready, do people really think nothing has the potential to go wrong here? Accidents happen. Even if the tech is better than humans, accidents will still happen. And Tesla will be an easy target with deep pockets for the blood sucking lawyers to go after. They are already settling wrongful death suits for their cars that are at least partially operated by humans (Source: [Tesla settles lawsuit over Autopilot crash that killed Apple engineer]( Putting millions of self-driving robotaxis on the road all at once will only increase the odds and number of accidents. Without tort reform, accounting for losses due to litigation, this is likely to be a money losing endeavor and not the huge potential source of future profits the market is expecting it to be. Lastly, my favorite piece of vaporware: The Optimus robot. This rehash of the old ASIMO from Honda is the dumbest thing ever. There is absolutely no consumer market for this whatsoever. As Honda learned, the risks are huge here. As soon as these heavy robots lands on a human when they fall over and hurts them, it's game over. This will be a class action drool fest for the lawyers out there. I can see the billboards already: ""Have you been hurt by an Optimus? Call 1-800-SUE-ELON"". Tesla can't get cars with four-wheels to drive themselves down paved roads with painted lines on them. And they are somehow going to recreate a far more complex bipedal human that operates in free space with a robot using the same computer? Yeah, not going to happen except in vaporware demos using AI to generate imagery. This is ten years out at a minimum and would require a massive investment that has yet to be made. It is far more challenging than making EVs (even FSD EVs). Show me one of these robots walk into house with toys randomly scattered on the floor, unload groceries, and prepare a scrambled egg and I will eat my words (along with the egg). The commercial application for the Optimus is also nonsense with other competition already way out in front. BMW is working with company called Figure that is using it's second generation of humanoid robots to build cars in Spartanburg, SC (Source: [Humanoid Robots for BMW Group Plant Spartanburg]( And let's all conveniently forget the robots coming out of China (check them out for yourself). Again, Tesla is way behind here and being viewed as the only player in this space and the only potential beneficiary of any future humanoid robot. It's simply ridiculous. I end with this: The powerful ERDF is real and continues to provide Elon and Tesla with an endless supply of investors with exuberant and cult-like belief in anything he says that will willfully ignore reality along with all past performance and competition.

Tesla Robotaxi - Musk sees it as infinite money hack - My crude study gets profit of $18.57 per share if it entirely displaced Uber & Lyft.,"TESLA profits go**down**70%, stock goes**up**7%. Pretty inexplicable other than hopes and dreams propping it up. A main component of the hopium is Musk continuing to dangle robotaxi out there. Notably, this is now the 11th years where Musk has ""hoped"" to have robotaxi in the next year (its shooting to have test robotaxis going in Austin in June, but there were some acknowledgments on the earnings call there would be remote operator standby assistance for those in case of issues, meaning it will not be a true robotaxi yet). Musk continually touts robotaxi as a seemingly infinite money hack where there has ""never be anything like this rapid of value creation"" in the history of mankind. Nobody seems to be pushing back on this so let's see where we're at actually at with the value of a robotaxi. This is a crude study of how to value robotaxi. **First,**Musk said on the earnings call that people will not own cars in the future; instead, everybody will just use robotaxis. I disagree with this. Even if robotaxis exist, if cars are still in the $20k to $50k range (which is already the case and EVs are getting cheaper), I expect most people that currently own a vehicle would still want to own one if they're still affordable - among other reasons, you would want to know you have a vehicle for your own personal use and is there when you want to use it, you may not want strangers sitting in your vehicle and farting in the seats all day etc. From this perspective, it begins to look more like Tesla would be displacing Uber and Lyft - i.e., the current rideshare businesses - as opposed to literally everybody everywhere not owning a car and only using robotaxi. **Second,**from a business component, and from Google searches, it appears as though Uber and Lyft charge, all-in, about $1.80/mile, with Uber and Lyft getting about a 30% cut, or $0.54 per mile. Uber and Lyft had a combined 2024 revenue of $49.7 billion. This would translate to**92.03 billion miles driven in 2024 across Uber and Lyft.** **Third**, if we assume the robotaxi version Tesla manages to produce will cost about $25k, and dividing that by the average car lifespan of 160,000 miles (from a Google search), we get the cost per mile to build the robotaxi of $0.15 per mile. **Fourth**, now, if we assume Tesla undercuts Uber and Lyft (as it would have to in order to take away their market share), and we assume Tesla undercuts them by 50%, then we end up with Tesla charging $0.90 per mile. Subtract out the $0.15 per mile of the cost of building the robotaxi and we end up with $0.65 per mile profit (this is a crude, and high approximation for profit as it ignores business overhead, maintenance expenses for the car, etc.). At $0.65 per mile profit, and if it took all 99.4 billion miles that Uber and Lyft drove last year, that would mean Tesla**generates an annual profit off of robotaxis of $59.8 billion**. With Tesla having 3.22 billion shares outstanding, this would be**profit of $18.57 a share**. If we gave that**Uber's P/E ratio of 16**you end up with**$297 a share**. **Summary**: If we approximated Tesla robotaxi as completely displacing Uber and Lyft - i.e., effectively the entire ride-share market - and Tesla undercut Uber and Lyft by charging for rides 50% as expensive as Uber and Lyft, and Tesla had a 70% profit margin on those rides,**could get $18.57 profit a share and at a P/E of 16 like Uber, would be a share price of $297.** The share price/value creation potential actually is pretty significant, but, notably, even if it entirely displaced Uber and Lyft, a $297 share price would only be an 18% increase from where it is now at $250. And, if robotaxi doesn't pan out in nearly the way Musk hopes, there is way more downside than the 30% upside as the fair value of Tesla from a car manufacturer perspective is probably under $100 per share, potentially under $50 a share. Notably, this analysis does not factor in company and administrative expenses as to costs per mile for robotaxi, nor does it factor in that competition may drive Tesla ride prices lower than 50% of what Uber and Lyft are current charging - e.g., Waymo or other robotaxi services that will inevitably come about. Nor does it factor in Musk's Optimus robot nonsense as that is far, far too speculative. It also ignores the profits Tesla would make on cars it sold since, as recent earnings have shown, it's profit on car sales is now about $0.12 a quarter and would me marginal compared to the $18.57 a share profit from robotaxi. I'm not a Tesla fanboy. I was just curious if there's even some plausible route for Tesla to justify its valuation. The answer is there is a route where robotaxi could be lucrative enough to get there, although it's not very probable as it requires virtually no competition and for Tesla to actually deliver on robotaxi.

Tesla CEO Musk says time he spends on DOGE will drop significantly next month,"TeslaCEO Elon Musk began his companys earnings call on Tuesday by saying that his time spent running President Donald Trumps Department of Government Efficiency will drop significantly starting in May. Musk, who has watched Teslas stock tumble more than 40% this year, said hell continue to support the president with DOGE to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back. After spending almost $300 million in the 2024 campaign to help return Trump to the White House, Musk created DOGE and joined the administration with a mission to drastically reduce the size and capability of the federal government. He said hell continue to spend a day or two per week on government issues for as long as the president would like me to do so.

Tesla shares tumble ahead of first-quarter earnings report,"Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Monday, a day ahead of the electric vehicle companys first-quarter earnings report, as analysts fret over ongoing brand erosion. The stock closed at $227.50 leaving it less than $6 above its low for the year on April 8. The shares are now down 44% for the year after wrapping up their worst quarter since 2022 in March. Its the 12th time this year the stock has dropped by at least 5% in a single session. CEO Elon Musks many distractions outside of Tesla, especially his role within the Trump administration, are in focus, along with the companys progress on a long-delayed robotaxi and self-driving technology for its existing cars. In the online forum that Tesla uses to solicit investor inquiries in advance of its earnings calls, more than 300 questions were submitted pertaining to Teslas self-driving systems, around 200 came in about the companys Optimus humanoid robots in development, and more than 160 questions poured in about Musk individually. One investor asked, What steps has the board of directors taken to mitigate the brand damage caused by Elons political activities? After spending $290 million to help return Trump to the White House, Musk is now leading an initiative to slash tens of thousands of federal jobs, sell off or end leases for federal office buildings, and reduce U.S. government capacity. Musks politics and antics have elicited a massive backlash in Europe and parts of the U.S. This year, the company has been hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk. Earlier this month, Tesla reported 336,681 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, a 13% decline from the same period a year earlier. The company is expected to report revenue of $21.24 billion for the first quarter, according to LSEG, which would mark a slight drop from the same period last year. Analysts expect earnings per share of 40 cents. Investors will be paying particularly close attention to any commentary about Trumps widespread tariffs and the potential impact on revenue and earnings as the year progresses. Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a note out Monday that ongoing brand erosion for Tesla in the U.S. and Europe is weighing on sales already, but a bigger issue for the company is potential weakness in China demand and margin impact due to the Trump tariffs. They wrote that competition in China, coupled with nationalistic consumer trends there, could drive sales toward domestic brands. Tesla would then have to export more of its China-made cars, which could lead to downward pressure on pricing, the Oppenheimer analysts said. Caliber, a research firm that tracks how U.S. consumer sentiment is shifting around major brands, found that only 27% of its survey respondents in March would consider purchasing a Tesla, compared to 46% in January 2022. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, is hoping for a turnaround vision from Musk on Tuesdays earnings call. Tesla has now unfortunately become a political symbol globally of the Trump Administration/DOGE, he wrote, noting that Teslas stock has been crushed since Trump stepped back into the White House. Ives estimated 15% to 20% permanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created by working for Trump. Late last week, Barclays maintained the equivalent of a sell rating and slashed its price target on Tesla to $275 from $325, citing a confusing set-up on the first-quarter with weak fundamentals. The firm said it could see a positive reaction if Musk is more focused on his automaker, and depending on what the company discloses about an anticipated FSD event, referring to Teslas Full Self-Driving offering. Tesla said inannouncing its reporting datethat, in addition to earnings, it will provide a live company update, language the company hasnt typically used in disclosures.

The illusion of diversifying your portfolio,"The traditional wisdom of dont put all your eggs in one basket has been the foundation of portfolio management for generations. But in todays market, most investors who think theyre diversified are actually carrying far more correlated risk than they realize. Heres whats happening: 1. The Indexation Effect: With the massive shift to passive investing, stocks now move in lockstep more than ever before. When everyone buys the same indexes, everything goes up and down together. 2. Sector Blurring: Is Tesla an auto company, a tech company, or an energy company? Is Amazon retail or cloud computing? The lines between sectors have blurred so much that traditional sector diversification doesnt work like it used to. 3. Algo-Driven Markets: Most trading today is algorithmic, and these algos often use similar factors and signals. When volatility hits, they tend to rush for the exits at the same time, causing even traditionally uncorrelated assets to move in sync. What Ive observed in my portfolio and others is that during calm markets, everything seems fine and diversified. But the moment real stress hits, correlations spike across supposedly different assets and sectors. Real diversification today isnt about having different stocks or even different asset classes. Its about having exposure to fundamentally different economic forces and risk factors.",stocks,2025-04-21,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k44x1q/the_illusion_of_diversifying_your_portfolio/,"I've read an interesting story on how young people used to put 60% of there investment money in the S&P500 and 40% in government bonds. Slowly but surely it turned into 100/0. Add onto that that the S&P 500 for the most part exists of 7 companies and the plan doesn't seem nearly as stable anymore.You dont understand the point of diversification. You literally cant diversify away overall market risk, which is what youre describing and is a lesson they teach in a 101 finance class. The point is to diversify away individual investment risk. If Cloudstrike has a bug that causes a 20% drop it pays to not be 100% invested in Cloudstrike and instead diversified between a few cybersecurity firms or a Cybersecurity ETF.Counterpoint: - VTI (market-cap weighted US stocks): -10.4% YTD - VXUS (market-cap weighted ex-US stocks): +4.4% YTD - BND (US total investment-grade bond market): +2% YTD - GLD (gold bullion ETF): +24.7% YTD Portfolios diversified across multiple asset classes have outperformed those concentrated in US stocks only so far this year.I dont see a valid argument for why diversification is an illusion. You just mentioned ppl buy similar indices which is true. You mentioned that there is confusion regarding the categorization of different companies, which is true, and you mentioned that ppl use algorithms which rely on similar signals which is true. None of that explains why diversification doesnt work. Instead it just states that individuals investors are doing a bad job building diversified portfolios.Very well said. I hope this post reaches the top of the sub because I think its under appreciated by many retail investors. True diversification in todays market means something different than conventional thinking from 20 years ago",
Predictions for the effect of Tesla earnings on Tuesday?,"I am very much aware that Tesla is an irrational stock that is not attached to reality. It's somehow a cult of personality and meme stock that has one of the biggest market caps in the world. But as of a month ago, all the circumstances pointed towards the meme finally being ready to burst. 1) It would be hard to pretend the company was still growing when it's clearly shrinking. Netflix lost subscribers for one quarter and the stock fell from $800 to $200 in a few days. (I know it recovered, but it shows the dramatic reaction the market has to the idea of a growth phase ending). Tesla trades at insane P/Es because it's priced like a tech startup ready to explode and it certainly would be hard to think of it as a company with infinite growth potential when it's objectively shrinking. If it were any other stock, objective data showing it to be a shrinking company would absolutely crush the stock price. A shrinking company operating at 150 P/E is absurd. 2) The cult of personality was starting to fall apart as Elon became one of the most controversial and hated people in the world as he gleefully destroyed the US government and various other things like supporting the AfD. 3) Tesla became one of the most hated companies in the world. Daily protests at Tesla dealerships, people embarrassed and/or scared to drive them, Elon alienates the demographic that would be interested in electric cars, and leans hard into the crowd that hates them. It got so bad that Tesla stopped taking their own trade-ins and their value on the used market is plumetting. 4) 10+ years of broken ""just around the corner"" tech promises. I'd like to say you can't keep fooling people like that but, well, *points to reality*. They're nowhere near complete FSD, their robots are people in costumes, etc. It seemed to me like the bubble around Tesla was ready to burst, and so I bought a lot of puts expiring between Apr 25 and May 16 as I expected the earnings report to be the unavoidable moment of reckoning that would force the market to face reality. On the other hand 1) Tesla seems to trade on an inverse news basis. Bad news for Tesla? Stock goes up. We saw the delivery numbers had declined a couple of weeks ago and the stock went up 5%. Will earnings day just be a repeat of that? We see objectively bad number and the stock paradoxically soars? 2) We're in a completely chaotic market right now where all anyone wants to know is whether Trump is going to commit national economic suicide or if he's going to pull out at the last second. I'm not sure any individual stock's merits matter at this point. It seems like the whole market is on hold, holding its breath, waiting to see if we're going to start Great Depression 2: Electric Boogaloo. If Trump caves, the market will soar. If we start seeing the effects of stopping the flow of Chinese goods, the market is finally going to have to recognize that the US has completely destroyed itself and it'll have to crash. In comparison, the performance for any particular stock now seems unimportant. So I worry that any news that's bad for Tesla ends up getting lost in all the noise of the much bigger issues. 3) The Trump wildcard factor. When Tesla started to fall, Trump did a commercial from the white house for Tesler. If the stock starts to fall again, does Elon have the power to get him to do something crazy? Maybe another massive pump of the market with some fake tariff news that boosts the whole market and Tesla along with it? I'm not sure where Elon is at with Trump right now but I'm afraid with one tweet Trump could erase the effect of bad news on Tesla (while doing a trillion or two of damage in the process) I invested a significant amount of my portfolio in Tesla falling, particularly in the next 3 weeks. I made these investments a month or two ago when it seemed like a pretty good bet. Now I'm not sure what to expect. If earnings day goes by and Tesla stock doesn't care, or worse, paradoxically surges, I will have wasted quite a bit of investing. So I'm curious what you guy think about what will happen this week for Tesla.",stocks,2025-04-20,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k3jhq6/predictions_for_the_effect_of_tesla_earnings_on/,"The earnings will be catastrophic, the stock price will go up by 5-7%I also think that Monday/Tuesday is the big correction. News about them postponing their affordable car that was promised was strategically released going into the weekend, so they are obviously trying to weaken the blow that is coming. Even if TSLA is a meme stock, I find it hard to believe the big institutional buyers are going to pump it again with all the negativity surrounding Elon and the Tesla brand. I'm in on puts for around 20% of my portfolio because I just don't see any way the TSLA party could continue. The only thing that would reverse the stock in my mind is Trump canceling all his tarries plans, and I just can't see that happening in the new two days.Earnings will be down huge. Sales falling is one thing, but they also don't have mark to mark Bitcoin gains this time. Earnings could easily be under $0.30. As for the stock price, who knows. My personal prediction, EPS of $0.15 and negative cash flow. 20% drop in stock price. Beyond that depends on how honest they are with guidance.You missed the most important point... Tesla execs have been leaving en masse for the past 6 months. That's the thing that tells you the party is over. These people are making GOBS of money (they are all filthy rich), and they have power and status and are doing what they supposedly love (they are the leading experts in their areas)... and they just packed up and got the fuck out. My prediction (but I wouldn't bet on it) is a 20% drop in the stock after earnings. Then a continued slide over the months to come.Tesla has managed to make itself evil to 1/2 the US and like 3/4 of the Western world. He did a Nazi salute. Not even the oil and tobacco companies are as despised at the moment. Its over for Tesla. The brand is dead. Car business is low margin. The company was all brand and now its toast.",
The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions is over, according to the Bank of Americas latest survey. Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trumps tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated. While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isnt the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall a scenario todays US market is particularly vulnerable to. One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed. Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively. Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform. However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026. The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025. All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past. In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform. Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market. Mr Gimber explains: One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running. This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.",stocks,2025-04-19,4826,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2ys45/the_era_of_american_stock_market_exceptionalism/,"i mean peaking at 70% of the world global equity market with 4% of the population would be totally fineHeard the same thing at least 10 years ago buy emerging markets, buy developed foreign countries, buy China.

My father thinks he is a guru,"Does anyone have some good responses to wannabe gurus who are so convinced by their wave analyses that nothing can change their mind?

Lessons learned from yesterday,"Yesterday was another crazy day that I live through without stress. Why? I basically exited from us stock market since January. However, I feel that there are a few things that I learnt that I will share: - US stock markets are, in the best of cases unpredictable at this point, in the worst case, directly manipulated. In the short term I will avoid US stocks and focus on fundamentals - And fundamentals doesn't look good. 1) The rest of the world has feel a taste of what is coming, and will look how to decouple from US as fast as possible. And starting from services... 2) Institutional investors will run away from US markets asap. Imaging being a pension fund manager from Europe or Australia and be through all latest movements. For sure, they will look for alternatives and now is probably the best moment for it. 3) Yesterday many probably become rich, but real economy will have a shock in a few months. DOGE and tariffs will raise unemployment and inflation. It is just a question of time that it translate into quarterly results. And don't expect investments with Al uncertainty. - Avoid US indexes. The main advantage they provided, diversification, it's over due to the fact that, at this moment whole US companies move in the same direction based on political decisions. In addition, there are companies like Tesla clearly overpriced and that weight too much on some indexes. - US bonds are not anymore 100% safe. Good luck to everyone. PS: Personally I am 95% cash and I will start investing in individual stocks that I feel have strong fundamentals ( whenever possible based outside US and which profits and are not heavily dependant on US).

Musk's companies, specifically Tesla (NASDAQ:ISLA), stand to be impacted by the tariffs.

The sell-off brings Apples three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that has wiped out $638 billion in market cap. Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, analyst say, due largely to its reliance on China, which is facing 54% tariffs.

"Tesla bull slashes stock price target 43%, citing Musk and Trump","[ (Bloomberg) One of Wall Streets most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trumps trade policies. Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst whos rated the carmakers shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty. Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Ives biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US presidents tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinpings government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trumps so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products. This will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others, Ives said in his note issued Sunday. We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate. Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances. The stock has fallen 50% from its record high reached Dec. 17.",stocks,2025-04-06,353,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jt1wlc/tesla_bull_slashes_stock_price_target_43_citing/,"$315?

Rocket Lab vs SpaceX: The AntiMusk Space Investment Campaign,"RKLB: The MuskFree Space Stock Ready to Soar Elon Musks antics and political ties are starting to spook investors from protests at Tesla showrooms to falling sales . Enter Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB), a pure-play space company with no Musk baggage and strong fundamentals. Rocket Lab just posted record revenue of $436 million in 2024 (up 78% YoY) , yet the stock has pulled back after a recent dip, creating an opportunity. Heres why RKLB could be a stellar long-term pick: * Beating Expectations, Despite the Dip: Q4 2024 revenue jumped 121% year-over-year . But cautious Q1 guidance (\~$120M vs $135M expected) spooked the market, and RKLB stock fell \~11% on that news now down \~30% in the past month . This pullback looks technical, not fundamental, as the company is still growing fast. * Strong Backlog & Partnerships: Rocket Labs order backlog hit $1.1billion by end-2024 , nearly half from government contracts. They build satellites for NASA/DoD and just won a role in the U.S. Space Forces NSSL program (a launch contract pool worth up to $5.6B) . In short, reliable revenue streams backed by government and commercial clients. * Upcoming Catalyst Neutron Rocket: In 2025, Rocket Lab plans to debut Neutron, a medium-lift, partially reusable rocket aimed at competing with SpaceXs Falcon 9 . Management confirms its on track for H2 2025 launch . Success could unlock larger payload missions and massive new contracts. (Some skeptics think it slips to 2026 , but even a slight delay doesnt derail the vision.) * Elon Who? Unlike SpaceX, Rocket Lab is publicly traded and not tied to Musks volatility. Musks close alliance with politicians and controversial behavior are now seen as business risks . By contrast, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck stays out of politics and focuses on execution. That makes RKLB a cleaner investment narrative if youre wary of key-man risk. Bottom line: Rocket Lab offers high growth (launch and satellite services) without the Musk drama. Analysts are bullish too (price targets range \~$2433 , well above the current price). With the stock trading off its highs and Elons shine wearing off, RKLB could be ready for liftoff in portfolios looking for the next space success story.

"Waymo reports 250,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in U.S.","Alphabetreported Thursday that Waymo, its autonomous vehicle unit, is now delivering more than 250,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in the U.S. CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo has options in terms of business models across geographies, and the robotaxi company is building partnerships with ride-hailing app Uber, automakers and operations and maintenance businesses that tend to its vehicle fleets. We cant possibly do it all ourselves, said Pichai on a call with analysts for Alphabetsfirst-quarter earnings. Pichai noted that Waymo has not entirely defined its long-term business model, and there is future optionality around personal ownership of vehicles equipped with Waymos self-driving technology. The company is also exploring the ways it can scale up its operations, he said. The 250,000 paid rides per week are up from 200,000 in February, before Waymo opened inAustinand expanded in theSan Francisco Bay Areain March. Waymo, which is part of Alphabets Other Bets segment, is already running its commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin regions. Earlier this month, Waymo and its partner Uber, began allowing interested riders to sign up to try the robotaxi service in Atlanta when it opens this summer. The early pioneer in self-driving technology, Waymo has managed to beat Elon Musk-ledTeslaand a myriad of now-defunct autonomous vehicle startups to the U.S. market. Tesla is promising that it will be able to turn its Model Y SUVs into robotaxis by the end of June for a driverless ride-hailing service it plans to launch in Austin. After about a decade of promises and missed deadlines, Teslastill does not offer a vehicle thats safe to use without a human at the wheel ready to steer or brake at all times. Musk criticized Waymos approach to driverless tech on his companysfirst-quarter earningscall on Tuesday. Musk said Waymo autonomous vehicles are very expensive and made in only low volume. Teslas partially automated driving systems rely mostly on cameras to navigate, while Waymos driverless systems rely on lidar technology, other sensors and cameras. Would-be competitors to Waymo also includeAmazon-owned Zoox, Mobileye, May Mobility and international autonomous vehicle companies such as WeRide and Baidus Apollo Go.

How should we treat earning reports after this wild tariff?,"With all the tariff drama lately, I honestly have no idea how much weight to put on earnings this season. I used to pay a lot of attention to earnings, but this time feels different. Consumer spending probably got a boost in March/April from people trying to buy stuff before any price hikes hit. And the 90-day pause on tariffs gives companies just enough breathing room to hold off on guidance revisions for now. So were not really getting the full picture. Feels like this quarters reports might be kind of misleading. Anyone else feeling the same? Are earnings still worth taking seriously right now? BTW: Not specifically means Tesla, just in general.",stocks,2025-04-21,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k433vw/how_should_we_treat_earning_reports_after_this/,"I don't give two shits about these earnings. Next quarter I'm all ears. I feel like most companies aren't going to give guidance or they'll do what Delta (? some airline) did and give two sets of numbers. One for a recession and one for no recession.I think people will shrug it off even if it's good, cuz it will look veryy different in 3 monthsNobodys even mentioning that probably roughly a million people or who knows how many lost their jobs over the last two months, whether they were one of the 300k federal workers directly laid off, or one of the people working on programs and such that were supported by the federal government. Like the scale Ive seen personally actually exceeds what I saw during Covid. Thats going to impact both earnings, and Lebrons legacy.Damage will show up in the next 1+ earnings reports, guidance will be absent, contingent, vague, or worthless with regard to expected outcomes. Best value from guidance will be discussion around actions companies are taking. In this environment, Im aiming to hold index based positions, and look for trades in blue chips with strong trailing PE (read as: low relative to the companys historical trailing PE) and good balance sheets. Im looking 1-7 months out for trade horizons. We cant predict anything, so valuation is the most useful consideration at this time.

Hertz shares surge more than 50% after Bill Ackman takes big stake in the rental car firm,"[ Bill Ackmans Pershing Square took a sizable stake in [Hertz]( rental-car company that exited from bankruptcy four years ago, sparking a big rally. Shares of Hertz surged 56% on Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed Pershing Square had built a 4.1% position as of the end of 2024. Pershing has significantly increased the position to 19.8% through shares and swaps, becoming Hertz second largest shareholder, a person familiar with the matter told CNBCs Scott Wapner. The person said Ackmans investment firm received an exemption from the SEC to delay the filing of the position until Wednesday, which allowed it to accumulate substantially more shares. Hertz has been a troubled company for much of the past decade, including bankruptcy during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021, the company bet heavy on all-electric vehicles, specifically Teslas, which cost the company billions following a significant decline in their residual values.

Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow,"Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because ""Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City"" is a longer trip than ""Shanghai to Los Angels"". And because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.) A natural question when you hear this is, ""if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?"" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.** I was going to title this post ""financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow"", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job. Who's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12 cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month. Now, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrowbut they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem. Okay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance. So yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled ""sell everything"", because that's not their job. Maybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of moneylike if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on. Hell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other. What I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",investing,2025-04-30,456,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kb4bkz/financial_professionals_mostly_arent_paid_to_care/,"There are plenty of global macro allocators who will sell equities and buy bonds or other countries allocators.

Yup, just checked, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Transportations are substantially down from election night, and have not rebounded. Funny that. Global petroleum prices also down. As one would expect. So your immediate scenario was already anticipated correctly it seems. Markets also price in expected central bank actions and money creation. If theyre anticipating interest rate declines that keeps overall markets up.A few points... Most (especially retail) financial professionals dont give a damn about the markets outside of how it makes their clients more or less nervous to invest more assets. Brokers are asset gatherers. They get paid for the amount of money they manage, not on performance. Dodd Frank was the greatest gift in the world to brokers, disguised as increased oversight. Purely transactional advisors would average ROA of about 0.35%. Dodd Frank pushed everyone from being a broker to Advisor (66 licence) which immediately increased their ROA to 1% of assets, because they were now acting in an advisory role. Now brokers will hire outside managers to actually allocate the money, which provides distance for them in the case of underperformance. They can move your money from one manager to another, but they still get paid. Index fund managers are even less interested in performance, just tracking errors. True fund managers do care about performance, which is ironic since in any given year, 70-90% will underperform static indexes, and charge you 2&20 for the privilege. HFTs aren't the entire market, but they do make up between 50-70% of an average days total trading volume. They are like gnats for natural traders, slightly too annoying to ignore, but they wont change your plans if you have a couple hundred thousand to sell.His main point is that no one cares what the SP500 does. That is the most obviously not true thing Ive ever read.What are we going to do about it? Answer - the same thing we always do: holdPoor people save in cash. Rich people own assets that appreciate with time. In general it is better long term to be a home owner than a renter, business owner instead of employee, asset owner instead of cash saver. Even in times of darkness, the asset owners that can withstand the downside come out better on the other side on the final analysis. You cant get to be a 20 year asset owner without getting through 10. Cant get to 40 year owner without getting through 20. Every 5 years there will be a compelling reason to why it is time to not be an owner. This is right on schedule. Nothing new under the sun. Best of luck.",

And youll learn why people in the know are worried. **TL;DR**: Bond yields arent just a number theyre a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, its not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Heres why thats dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power. ## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds*** Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trumps Liberation Day tariff announcement. However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot. The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. ## **What is a Treasury Bond?** Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That little extra is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. Its an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time. So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more. Lets say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. Thats a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield. Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand. Now lets say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) a big jump from the original 1% yield! As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up they move inversely. This is worth emphasizing: The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8). - If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11. - If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11. - If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11. The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return. Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields. Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)? Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature! Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere. Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts. ## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?** Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it cant offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money. Think about it this way: Imagine youre a builder in a town called Springville. For years, youve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom. Heres the issue: You cant continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers wont be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000? If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, youll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere. You might say: Well, so what? I dont care what the government pays in interest. Not my problem! *Oh, it is very, very much your problem.* This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark. Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it. So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow and so do you. Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board. Thats bad for: - **Homebuyers** higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments - **Businesses** higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand - **The government** more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure - **The stock market** investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop. Its a double whammy. Thats why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you dont own a single bond yourself. ## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?** I want to say just because but that wouldnt satisfy you. Its not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but its the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot. Treasuries (so far) are considered risk-free. Theyre backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So theyre a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost. Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, whos always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so theres plenty of data on what rate people charge him and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline. Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You dont know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. Thats how the market treats borrowers it builds off the known risk-free rate. But why the 10-year treasury specifically? Its not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans. Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally. In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts dont key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; its seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone. Other examples include: - UK 10-year Gilt a common benchmark for domestic British rates. - Japanese 10-year used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy. - Chinese 10-year also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent. These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist. The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes: - Deep liquidity - Transparent, market-based pricing - Long track record of stability - Dollar dominance many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated - Safe-haven status during global crises When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score. If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. Thats why predictability is essential investors need confidence, not surprises. ## **So Its Good to Be Randy Reliable?** Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollars position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly. Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably. However, theres a downside: A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad. Thats why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it. Yet, its a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S. A good article discussing all this can be found here: ## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?** Now youre getting it. The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership. So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends? Well, suddenly he doesnt seem like such a safe person to lend to. This is why the long part of the curve for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy. Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless? Thats the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem. Ill get to that in a bit. ## **The Yield is the Entire Field** So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership. As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower. So the rates theyre comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN. Thats because long treasuries lending to Randy Reliable have always been regarded as a safe haven. Remember, it represents the risk-free rate! When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place. More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines. But thats not what we saw last week! Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing. That was weird. The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven. Thats a scary thought. It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. ## **Wasnt I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?** Arent higher long-term bond yields a good thing? You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign. Thats when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds. This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk. More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you. This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. An inverted yield curve is a signal. It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring. Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety like Randy Reliable leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, its still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself. Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness. Thats not a recession signal. That is the disease. Thats a sovereign confidence event. Different animal. Nastier teeth. ## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?** Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more about $1 trillion. Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets. And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. Thats a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There arent enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot. Even though its just a 2% change in total inventory, its a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply wont be enough buyers with cash ready, and thats what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases. ## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers** Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts. They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers. And China, Japan, and Canada wouldnt even need to crash the market just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog. The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, theyre hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home. China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it. So are Canada and Japan. Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there. The dollars status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But theres no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, With great power comes great responsibility. When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, thats when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies, encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests. This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trumps policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power. ## **Cant the Fed Do Something?** Yes and no, but not really. Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries thats what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). But theres a catch: its much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility. When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable. If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall. So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets. ## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?** After reading this primer, many have suggested, why dont we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them! No, we do not have that power. Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt? Because thats how you do it. This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip. Its as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies. So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding Chinas notes makes about as much sense. It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about. As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000. I decide I hate Peter and tell him Im not paying back his loan and that I wont repay it if he sells it to anyone else. Peters loan becomes worthless. This situation is called a default. Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well. So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they dont trust me. The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back. Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans. Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates. ## **What Can We Do?** Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust. Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order. Trust comes from relationships and time. Theres an old adage: Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain. We are witnessing that in real time. Restoring trust may well take decades now. There will be no easy fix. Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead. *Open Source Note:* Feel free to copy, share, or adapt this post with credit for any non-profit, political, or educational use.

Happy to answer any questions, especially if you're curious about yield mechanics, QT vs QE, or the signaling impact of foreign selling. I've tried to explain it in plain, no nonsense language that anyone can follow. Any feedback would be appreciated! I hope this helps everyone understand what's going on.This is one of the clearest explanations I've seen connecting bond yields to global trust and economic staility. The Randy vs. Randy Reckless analogy really drives home how confidence (not just repayment) is what anchors the system. The point about rising 10-year yields during a downturn flipping the safe-haven narrative is eye opening and tying it to the strategic actions by countries like China dds an imporant global dimension. Really appreciate how accessible yet in-depth this was.Thank you for this thread, this came with a combination of things I didn't understand, and things I understood but couldn't explain. Have some internet points on me.Sometimes I hate Reddit, and then out of nowhere there are posts like yours where I fuckin love it. Well doneThis is a good analysis but its missing the effect of currency fluctuations with balance of payments. For example, if China sold all their US dollar denominated treasuries, they would receive US dollars in exchange. They would then have to sell USD to get CNY, which would cause their currency to go up relative to the dollar. The net effect would be imports from US to China become cheaper and imports from China to the US become more expensive. This would cause pain in their export driven economy that relies on a persistent trade surplus. They could use those US dollars to buy US goods and services, but that does the same thing. The goal of tariffs is to rebalance trade where its no longer a one way street. Selling USD denominated assets to buy local currency denominated assets makes US goods and services cheaper and more competitive on the global market. Then theres no need for tariffs. Mass foreign selling of US treasuries translates to a boost in US manufacturing and US exporters - which would increase the creditworthiness of treasuries.",
Tesla stock makes absolutely no sense,"If you look at the Tesla stock, you'll notice it shut up ""bigly"" right after the company announced a sharp decline in future orders and sales. I read a report about Tesla's sales in Scandinavian countries like Norway & Sweden following Elon Musk racist gesture during Trump speeches.

Why is Tesla stock slowly rising?,"All the news I've seen and read for the last couple of weeks is bad when it comes to Tesla but the stock seems to be going back up a little bit.

The people who would normally be selling off Tesla right now probably werent invested in the first place.Because the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solventTesla is rising due to the overall market bouncing to the last sharp decline, however it is rising with low volume, which indicates weak probability of extending the upside. Also There is still some optimism in the markets and hopes for Tesla, despite the bad quarter they had. Markets are mainly pricing a trade-deal and tariffs to ease which is leading stocks to recover, if anything goes wrong, you can expect another meltdown.TSLA is held by ETF's, mutual finds, etc. So there will be constant drip of investing to pull the price up.

Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Heres why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price),"A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Teslas tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearishand it has little to do with the political horizon. Heres why: **Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst** Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliancea reality that adds cost and complexity. The U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie wont be easy: * Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo. * Pricing will be criticaland Tesla is playing catch-up technologically. Even if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. marketa wildly optimistic scenarioit would generate \~$12 billion in revenue and $11.5 billion in profit over a decade or more. More realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \~$2 billion in revenue and \~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029. Compare that to Teslas current \~$80 billion revenue base. It would move the needle by only a few percentage pointsand thats assuming everything goes perfectly. Bottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity. **Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time** Teslas Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \~$30,000 target. At that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 35 years. Tasks like: * Cooking * Laundry * Grocery management * Lawn care and snow removal However, todays reality? Teslas current robots can walk, lift small objects, and wave awkwardlynowhere near complex, unpredictable home environments. Critical technical hurdles remain: * Navigating messy, human-dominated spaces * Handling fragile or variable items * Making autonomous decisions (e.g., fridge organization, unexpected obstacles) Without breakthroughs in sensing and manipulationwell beyond current camera-only perceptionit will be years before these tasks are reliably automated. To make matters worse, Tesla is leveraging a camera-only approach versus their competitors who are technologically superior (and not just by a bit, exponentially)leveraging LiDAR, radar, advanced depth, force and torque sensors, advanced tactile sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Boston Dynamics is easily 5-8+ years ahead of Tesla in this technological space. Factory deployment of 10,000 Optimus units for repetitive assembly line tasks by year-end? Possible. Household robots folding your laundry? Not this decade. Musks historic promises around autonomy make cautious skepticism wise: * 2014: ""90% of miles autonomous in 3 years."" * 2016: ""LA to NYC trip without a single touch."" * 2020: ""Level 5 autonomy this year."" (Reality, of course, has been less obedient.) So, while Optimus could shine in tightly controlled environments, it's unlikely to drive meaningful consumer or enterprise revenue before 2030. **Tesla's Financial Trajectory: The Red Flags** Teslas latest earnings report (Q1 2025) showed: * 71% drop in net income year-over-year * 9% decline in revenue * 20% drop in automotive revenue * Significant market share erosion in key markets Without $595 million in regulatory credits, Tesla would have posted a $189 million net loss this quarter. The underlying trendlines are flashing yellow, if not red. **Dark Pool Moves: Insider Games?** Since earnings, Tesla has seen an explosive increase in dark pool trading volumeprivate institutional trades designed to mask large-scale buying or selling. Coupled with decreased short interest and bullish options activity, it suggests a manufactured sentiment shift rather than organic investor enthusiasm. In plain English: insiders are moving stealthily, likely repositioning ahead of retail reactions. **Final Take** Given the operational, technical, and competitive realities outlined above, I do not believe Tesla will achieve new revenue streams significant enough to materially impact its bottom line within the next 5 to 7 years. Despite exciting tech demos, neither Robotaxi nor Optimus are poised to materially move Teslas bottom line within the next 57 years. Meanwhile, core auto sales are under pressure, and financial trends are deteriorating. Short-term market maneuvers may cause volatility, but the fundamentals do not justify long-term bullishness at todays valuations. **Fact Validation** I made the decision to fact check myself with ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google) and Grok (X / Twitter). Here's the fact check: Robotaxi \- Tesla has said they will unveil the robotaxi vehicle in August 2024, aiming for service launch by 2025. Confirmed. \- Remote monitoring is confirmed (source: Tesla earnings call Q1 2025). Confirmed. \- U.S. taxi/rideshare market revenue: \~$52B in 2024, growing to \~$61B by 2029 (Statista and IBISWorld confirm this). Confirmed. \- Waymo is indeed operational in Phoenix, SF, LA, and Austin, expanding into Atlanta, DC, Miami, and Tokyo (Waymo official updates April 2025). Confirmed. \- Your assumption of 25% capture is very generous Uber has >70% share vs. Lyft after a decade so 25% for Tesla is very ambitious, making your $2B realistic even if optimistic. Confirmed. \- Profit margins in rideshare: Uber's net margin is 25% despite scale. You're right that a \~$200M profit is realistic at best. Confirmed. Optimus Robot \- Elon has stated $20K$30K target price range (source: Tesla AI Day, reinforced Q1 2025 call). Confirmed. \- Musk acknowledged significant hurdles, particularly in object recognition and manipulation. Confirmed. \- Teslas robot demos still show very basic tasks (walking, lifting objects), no complex home task automation yet. Confirmed. \- Tesla historically overpromised autonomy timelines (you accurately documented Musk's timeline slip-ups bravo). Confirmed. \- Humanoid robot scaling into assembly line tasks is plausible, household use is years away. Confirmed. Tesla Financials Q1 2025 \- 71% drop in net income: Confirmed. \- 9% revenue decline: Confirmed. \- Auto revenue down \~20%: Confirmed. \- $595M regulatory credits: Confirmed. Without them, Tesla would have posted a net loss. Dark Pool Activity \- Post-earnings surge in dark pool activity is confirmed (based on trading desk reports and CBOE data).

Congratulations if you shorted Tesla.,"Title pretty much says it. Tesla is down 12% in premarket trading today and already down over 50% from it's high in December.

Apple and Microsoft are absolutely juggernauts compared to Tesla and Amazon. For awhile Bill Gates was the richest man but he isnt anymore.

Does anyone know what was done differently?,investing,2025-05-04,534,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kers0h/what_has_elon_musk_and_jeff_besos_done_that_made/,"Bill Gates sold most of his Microsoft stock if he didn't sell any he would be a trillionaire now. Same with Wozniak and Steve Jobs, they sold all their stock.Someone else has already mentioned it, but the biggest factor is holding onto the company equity they started with rather than diversifying. Gates would have been a trillionnaire a while ago if he'd just held onto his original Microsoft shares.They own a larger % of their companies. Half of that is because they are younger companies. Their shares will get diluted over timeI came here to say the same thing as one of the other comments but with more detail: why do you care about revenue? A company could make a trillion dollars a day in revenue, it wouldnt matter if it costs them more than a trillion to make that then theyd still have no profit. So you could move the goal post to profit instead, why is he so rich if Tesla doesnt make the most profit? Because the value of a company and stock isnt based directly on profit either, is investor sentiment of how the company will do in future. People think Tesla will be a profitable company in the future so they want to buy a piece of it now. (Same idea for Amazon obviously) Revenue is just one small piece of a giant and largely subjective equation.Bill Gates sold most of his stake in Microsoft and donated it to charity. Bezos and Musk have given paltry sums compared to Gates.",

TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it. But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF. I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down. So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetryon days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time. The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%. What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lotinflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work. The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models. An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420]( I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.) EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.",wallstreetbets,2025-04-30,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbit90/tsla_keeps_trading_like_a_leveraged_sp_500_etf/,"I've noticed this as well, OP; nothing rly to do thoughBe careful with Palantir, even though they have ridiculous high valuation, their revenue mostly comes from government contracts.",

$META Earnings already priced in be careful on Calls,"Ive noticed that when people expect something to happen in the market, they often price in the movement before it happens. Its harder to make money off of that initial move, but its easier to gamble on them being wrongor less right. Especially around earnings time, as we all saw with TSLA, everyone knew their earning would be shit. So the stock moved like shit. Then the earnings were horrendous. And we pumped??? Im well aware that TSLA is a meme stock and makes 0 sense, but I also believe that there is a lesson in that movement. I think there is a possibility of the flip side for META. Everyone thinks theyre going to have good earnings. The forecasts are high and the stock is up (with the rest of the market) in the last few days. Furthermore, in the past 10 *straight* quarters META has outperformed earnings estimates. Yet, they do not rise on earnings every time. Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings. So, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. If META underperforms? Blood. Many are expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as its done for the past 10 quarters. If META meets forecasts? I think theres a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. To back up this silly little thesis I have a table of METAs earnings reports along side the stocks movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. First thing youll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. Last thing Ill add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. Im a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it Ill lose money trying to find one! TL;DR I believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, its possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. Im not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings.",wallstreetbets,2025-04-30,64,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kb4qy9,"Yes, META earnings are priced in. Its a trillion-dollar company, thats expected... Pls read up on [Efficient-market hypothesis - Wikipedia]( The real question is whether the actual move/ realized volatility > IV. If yes, buying options like a straddle can work. If no, selling premium makes more sense. Its not about whether earnings are priced in. Its about whether the move beats expectations.Earnings is always a gamble (and a sham in TSLA's case). If the market made sense Google would be back to 180 today after their solid ER and announcing buybacks.Also, they could beat earning AGAIN and the stock is 25% cheaper than it was on the last call Ya dont really know whats priced in until you find out. DD: My own complete bias because I own RDDT calls and Id like a nice pop from META tailwinds before the earnings call.",

TSLA Short YOLO,"I posted a bit ago about my UNH short that worked out very well, and I've been reluctant to post things that aren't either closed or essentially already played out. But I figure this one is the last truly spicy one left in my portfolio at the moment and I figured I would share it as well. As a caveat, this is not investment advice. My overall portfolio is extremely conservative, so I can take some (fairly crazy) flyers here and there to get a bit of alpha. I've been (very happily) shorting TSLA in the medium-term. I can get into the full thesis later if anyone cares (it's not different than a majority of other bear cases on TSLA) but I started taking positions as soon as Elmo decided giving a Nazi salute was a cool idea. I like to enter positions with options strategies that are medium to long term (1 month or longer to expiry, a lot of LEAPS usually). I tend to have a mix of spreads and naked positions. With TSLA I have three positions outstanding. (1) April 25 2025 200/230 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 69k several months ago. My original thinking back when I bought it was to close it before the earning tonights. Thinking about rolling it outwards at least a week, though it's pretty expensive. If not, I'm also considerng roughly halving it before market close so that I've got my basis back and I'm just playing with house money on tonight's earnings print. (2) May 16 2025 235/250 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 15k the day after Trump cancelled the tariffs, figuring that the bounce upwards was really overpriced. This is another one I may cut in half. (3) June 2025 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 200/240 - paid relatively the most for this (40k) last week. It has a fair bit of time to expiry, so despite the bad pricing, I'm going to let this one ride a bit longer before re-evaluating a trim or closure of the position. All together, these open positions are about 125k in cost basis, sitting at around 100k in paper profits. It's bit more risk than I like given the bizarre price action that TSLA exhibits, even when it missed and even when it gives bad but blurry near team guidance. On the flip side, I think the fundamental story here is really really bleak. Elon has to successfully sell investors on some new radical fantasyland project to avoid a bad day tomorrow. I don't think simply saying ""I'm out of politics and focused on my companies"" is going to cut it.",wallstreetbets,2025-04-22,62,https://i.redd.it/ecd1s4qqcfwe1.jpeg,"Guy went full regard.. lets see if it works out for him, CottonI don't think this will work out ...

Each will be fully certified when they turn sixteen in the USA, eighteen for most other countries. Elon has 149 fully certified IVF Babies currently, enough for current demand in Austin and Dubai (bet you didn't think he'd been so prolific). There should be a gradual expansion of fully certified IVF Babies coming on board each year, with the supply hitting 500k in sixteen years, 2041. There is about a 27% loss now before full certification, and about a 3% annual loss after, Tesla is working on reducing those numbers.

"[DD] Even If Elon Ditches DOGE for Tesla Its Too Little, Too Late","Theres chatter that Elon might finally refocus on Tesla and distance himself from his side questsmost notably his weird obsession with Dogecoin. Bulls might think this is bullish: Hes coming back! Hes serious again! But heres the problem: he never left. He just stopped delivering. Overpromising Is the Default Under Elon Even if Elon announces hes giving up on crypto clownery to zero in on Tesla, the core issue remainshis leadership style has fundamentally eroded trust. Lets look at the record: FSD next year since 2016 still in beta, still not delivering revenue. Robotaxis by 2020 were halfway through 2025. $25K Model? Vaporware. Cybertruck timeline? Delays, recalls, meme features (like bulletproof claims). So, sure, maybe he tweets Im all-in on Tesla again, but the Street has been burned too many times to believe it without tangible execution. Sentiment Doesnt Flip With a Tweet The bigger issue? People just dont like him anymore. And that matters. Hes aligned himself with culture war politics that have turned off core EV buyers. His Twitter/X activity has been erratic, controversial, and alienating. ESG investors and climate-focused funds are increasingly bailing on TSLAnot because of performance, but because they cant sell Elon to clients anymore. Saying Im focused now doesnt undo years of brand damage. Tariffs Are Still Crushing the Global Thesis Even if Elon dials back the meme coins, the fundamentals dont magically improve: US-EV tariffs are active (and Chinese LFP battery costs just went up). China just nuked S/X listings. EU could retaliate with their own tariffs. And Tesla is retreating from markets like Japan, UK, and Australia by discontinuing models. This is structural. No PR pivot will fix supply chain pressure and margin hits. Could Elon Turn It Around? In theory, yes. If he: Delivered a real $25K model in 1218 months. Partnered with OEMs for FSD licensing. Cleaned up comms, stepped back from X, and re-focused the brand. Resigned as CEO and brought in an operations-focused leader. But lets be realElon stepping aside from Dogecoin is not the same as stepping aside from being Elon. And his entire brand is built around showmanship, not execution. Bottom Line Even if Elon says hes back, weve heard that song beforeand the markets tolerance for vapor promises is exhausted. Tesla is: A retreating brand. Losing trust. Still battling macro and regulatory headwinds. Talk is cheap. Tariffs arent. (Not financial advice. Just tired of waiting for the $25K Tesla.)",wallstreetbets,2025-04-21,331,https://i.redd.it/j9jnbfuwb8we1.jpeg,"Honestly him not being a spokesperson from Tesla is making it better for them right now.Anyone have word on whether Elons twitter posting volume is high today, or is he pretty quiet?I would unload a bit now before earnings take a great win since this is a meme stockIma laugh so hard when this pumps absurdly after bad earnings.

TESLA DD - THE MYTH OF BOUNCING ON BAD EARNINGS IS DEAD (aka why this quarter is set up for a bloodbath),"TL;DR Teslas rise on bad earnings is a dead meme. Those rare pops were driven by hype bombs that arent coming this time. Now, with public sentiment in the gutter, no guidance, tariff pain, Elon over-promising fatigue, and Model S/X getting pulled globally this earnings is a setup for a brutal downside move. BUT TSLA RISES ON BAD NEWS! NOT ANYMORE Lets shut this down: Q4 2024 is the only real exception: Tesla missed both revenue and EPS but rose ~4% only because Elon teased a June robotaxi launch and new low-cost model plans. That bounce came after hours, only after the callpurely driven by forward guidance. Without those surprise announcements? TSLA always drops on a miss. There is no consistent historical pattern of Tesla going up on bad earnings without major forward-looking hype. Thats not a trend. Thats luck + hopium. THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT IN THE WORST WAY 1. No Guidance, No Hype, No Lifeline No Model 2. No robotaxi demo. No solid FSD timeline. Last call? Elon basically said were not giving forward guidance anymore. 2. Elon Over-Promising = Worn Out Promised Full Self-Driving next year since 2016. Still in beta. Robotaxis by 2020. Nope. $25K Tesla soon. Still nothing. Investors have heard it all, and theyre not buying it anymore without real action. 3. Public Sentiment Is TRASH Musks alliance with Trump has alienated core Tesla buyers and ESG-focused investors. Hes become a culture war figure, not an innovation icon. His Dogecoin pumping and Twitter chaos have made Tesla feel more like a meme than a market leader. Google Trends, Twitter mentions, and retail chatter have all cooled significantlytheres no positive sentiment tailwind this time. GLOBAL MODEL PULLBACKS = BAD SIGNALS Tesla is literally discontinuing products in multiple markets: Model S & X canceled in Australia, New Zealand, UK, and Japan due to ending right-hand-drive production. China pulled U.S.-made Model S/X from its websiteno more Order Now buttons. Tariffs are biting. U.S. killed off Model 3 RWD, its cheapest EV, because Chinese-made LFP battery tariffs made it unprofitable. This is not growth. This is retreat. TARIFF WAR = MARGIN SLAUGHTER 10% U.S. tariffs on EVs are in effect, and reciprocals from the EU and China are brewing. Teslas global footprint means theyre hit from all sides. Elon himself admitted tariffs are significant. Translation: margins getting choked. OPTIONS + VOLATILITY Market is pricing a 9% move. Skew is to the downside: when theres no guidance and sentiment is weak, implied vol favors bearish plays. DISCLAIMER This post represents my personal opinion and is for entertainment and discussion purposes only. This is not financial advice.

TSLA Q2 Deliveries,"Not interestd in long-term debates about viability but, short-term, this has got to be peak uncertainty about the company's future. Q2 delivery consensus has come down a bit but estimates north of 350k still scream 'general TSLA challenges' not refelcting a scenario where Q2 winds up being a complete crisis quarter. Why couldn't Q2 deliveries potentially seize up and wind up coming in < 200k if only for one quarter? Q1 typically being weak, seasonality and other historical factors are of little value at this point in time as it seems like there has been a structural shift in the perception of TSLA that isn't going back anytime soon. In fact, so much has happened in such a short period of time that any projections based on YoY trends or growth rates seem antiquated to me. Looking Q1 25 as a baseline - Q2 2025 estimates that reflect an expectation of QoQ growth in units delivered seem aggressive to say the least when broken down regionally: 2025 Q1 Deliveries: 337k: US 128k China 79k EU 63k RoW approx. 67k with biggest shares from: Canada 8k SK/JPN 9k AU/NZ 6k Mid East/LATAM combine for 21k The current 367k Q2 consensus reflects 17% expected YoY decline in deliveries and, holding regional sales mix constant from Q1, implies Q2 expected deliveries: US 140k China 86k EU 69k RoW 73k Q1 deliveries were announced Apr 2, the morning of the 'recprocal' rate announcements. The quarter has just begun and the escalations in uncertainty that have taken place only very recently will impact TSLA for all of Q2 most likely. I'm having a tought time seeing US deliveries growing by 12k in Q2 vs the first three months of this year considering how quickly the brand has deteriorated... Above all however, I see the biggest shock risk in the EU and China for Q2 deliveries. On Friday we saw TSLA announce a pause on taking orders on certain models in China. That can obviously be rescinded on a whim but, at the same time, can be expanded just as easily too. I think the tit-for-tat risk with China and US tariff escalation may have peaked but headline risk is still high on a day-to-day basis and, given TSLA's proximity to the administration, any new flare ups are likely to hurt TSLA directly. In fact, I would go as far to say China might be inclined to take actions specifically targetting TSLA and Musk if for no other reason than the perceived rift it could cause between Trump and Musk. For China in Q2, can we really say there isn't at least an elevated chance that all new orders and deliveries could be paused at least temporarily? At the same time, I cannot fathom how EU Q2 deliveries could show an increase of 6k vs. Q1. I think very soon (gut sense says this month) we will see the EU and China announce a deal on EVs opening up the Euro Zone market for BYD and others.. EU EV market share is already falling off of a cliff with sentiment towards the US and Musk in particular continuing to decline further. I really think a comprehensive EV deal between China and the EU could mark the start of the end of TSLA in Europe. Canada might be relatively small overall but Q1 Canadian deliveries were 8.6k - my understanding is a significant majority of those were sold during a particular weekend in January to take advantage of a government EV credit that has since expired. A lot has changed even since January as far as US/Canada relations - does anyone really expect any TSLAs to be delivered in Canada this quarter? I could see this being the kitchen sink quarter that gives Musk the cover to step away from DOGE as he's needed back at TSLA FT to oversee the 'robot transition'. Afterall, it's been about a year since he told everyone robo taxis were only a year or so away so it's time to come back and pump everyone up with more fantastical promised.

Reminds me of my own success recently... Well, you know, I moved here because - well, I moved here because, you know, I had to leave the states, but I picked Thailand because I always had a thing for Asian girls, you know and when I got here I was like a kid in a candy store. If you got money, no attachments, nothing to do...I started partying. It got wild. I was picking up girls every night, always different ones, petite ones, chubby ones, older ones, sometimes multiple ladies a night. I was out of control, I became insatiable. And, you know, after about 1,000 nights like that you start to lose it. I started wondering where am I going with this? Why do I feel this need to fuck all these women? What is desire? The form of this cute Asian girl...why does it have such a grip on me, because she's the opposite of me? Is she gonna complete me in someway? I realized I could fuck a million women I'd still never be satisfied, maybe, maybe what I really want is to BE one of these Asian girls. So one night I took home some girl, turned out to be a ladyboy, which I'd done before, but this time instead of fucking the ladyboy, the ladyboy fucked me. And it was kind of magical. And I got in my head, what I really wanted was to be one of these Asian girls, getting fucked by me, and to feel that. So I put out an ad looking for a white guy, my age, come over and fuck me. Found a guy looked a lot like me. Then I put on some lingerie and perfume, made myself look like one of these girls. I thought I looked pretty hot. And then this guy came over and railed the shit out of me and then I got addicted to that. Some nights three, four guys'd come over and rail the shit out of me. Some I even had to pay. And at the same time I'd hire an Asian girl to just sit there and watch the whole thing. I'd look in her eyes and some guy was fucking me, and I'd think? I am her. And I'm fucking me.May have sold early theres a gap around 220 that needs to be filled",

Repost: It's all about China,"**Mods removed this post yesterday when it had 700 upvotes, probably because it became too political. Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.** **However, phase 2 is just beginning.** DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS. I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. Were a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country. \--Donald Trump, 1988 [Transshipment]( is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year. This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration]( with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage. Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018: * [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".]( In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.]( Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons. * Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.]( True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world. So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island]( closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence. What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one. **\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.** **""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me** **""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me** **""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me** However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028. tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression. **UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA** I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it. Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray... Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization. Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple: **Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.** **He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.** Simply put: AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS. However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week. \--- **Epilogue** Uneducated peasants gave Mao Zedong power because he was an iconoclast that claimed he could save them from a feudalistic society. When in power, he instead implemented his theory that none of his base understood. 45 million starved.

Then it was about Europe needing to pay their fair share for defense spending. Then it was about rare earth minerals in Ukraine and Greenland. Then it was 1:1 reciprocal tariffs. Then it was leveling out the entire global trade deficit. And now it's about China? Like many investors have learned the hard way over the last few weeks, it's a fool's errand to try and discern what the intentions are, what could happen tomorrow, what could happen at 3am from a post to TruthSocial, or what could happen next week. Which is the same reason nobody's spinning up new factories here because of this. Manufacturing plants take 5 years to build for a 50-year investment and god only knows what's going to happen two days or months from now that's going to wipe out a billion dollar capital investment in manufacturing. Because the patients are running the insane asylum, their demands change on a whim, and whatever incentives there are to invest in the US can change a moment's notice. Because there's ***no*** plan. Except maybe market manipulation and ego stroking. EDIT: For those who want to debate that it's always been about China, go for it, but you'll then have to explain why the best possible path forward was to alienate, quite literally, almost every country on the planet and every single one of our closest allies along the way.If it's all about China, why didn't he just target China from the start? Why turn Canada and Mexico and Europe against us for no reason? Why sabotage foreign investment by coming out with an insanely volatile and unpredictable policy regime? China is the biggest beneficiary of all of this nonsense. There will be damage to both the US and China, but trading partners and investors are going to look at China and see a rock they can build on while the US looks like a dingy in a storm. There's a lot of BS flying around for this to be ""all about China"".I believe you are giving this guy much more credit than he deserves. Trump is no genius, and he has no secret master plan vs China. Mind you, these guys were too stupid to keep a journalist off their Signal group chat discussing military plans. Considering the fact that most people in this world are just stupid, there's a good chance Trump and his advisors are legitimately dumb enough to think this tariff-thingy would've worked out well, and now they're backtracking for everyone except China, because he'd lose face by having ""lost"" vs. Chinas imposing tariffs.Im hoping for one more day of pump to get some of my positions out of the red and then I might exit individual stocks entirely for 6 months and reassess. And I was 75% cash already. Started selling in January. Yeah I want to buy the dip like anyone else but these waters are shark infested and retail investors are one huge chum bucket.",

It looks like somebody saved Musk from a margin call in 2022,"Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley]( included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer. But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms]( which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms]( with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof]( that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway. Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing]( saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October. It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms). Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement]( for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement]( obviouslyit would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible. Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call. I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**. It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholderVanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan. Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

watching for snapback setups off gap down open with historical reference and setup potential,"if open is lower than what we are all expecting, would focus on watching for short term reversal setups in a few oversold names. not necessarily entering into anything early but waiting for key levels to come into and watch for signs of exhaustion based on historical context in previous flushes discussed under, extreme pressure tends to revert when it gets stretched too far intraday. so as for the historical context framework, after the 1987 crash the dow recovered about 57 percent in the two sessions that followed the bottom. same thing happened after the 2008 october flush and again in march 2020. the context shifts but the structure tends to repeat. liquidity dries up, forced selling takes over, and once that flow slows down you often get sharp intraday reversals even in weak broader trends. in 87 the crash accelerated because of dynamic hedging strategies that sold more as prices dropped, creating a feedback loop that hit futures first and then cash markets. books got overwhelmed, bids vanished, and once that flow exhausted the bounce came fast. in 08 it was margin pressure and credit risk. banks had to unwind whatever was liquid and those with tighter funding positions, pretty much made the selling spiral worse until coordinated policy stepped in. same thing again in 2020 where no one knew what earnings or demand would look like so everything risk got dumped. volatility went to the moon and alot sectors started moving in sync, and depth disappeared until liquidity support came in and flipped the tape. now the potential black monday we face shouldnt be a repeat of 87 imo, but some of the same stress points are showing up. risk is extended, volatility is climbing, liquiditys thinning out, and this recent price action looks like the front end of a liquidation cycle. if we gap down hard and that volume keeps pushing into weak books, the key is watching when that forced flow dries up. thats usually when things snap back fast intraday and structure starts to reset. nothing guaranteed but its a pattern thats repeated across every major dislocation. recent positions similar to this framework include tsla calls on pre march 20th setups in hood, reddit and more. all of them opened heavy and reversed clean once selling pressure faded. setups were mostly based on volume spikes near prior levels and reclaiming vwap after early weakness. this kind of move matches intraday reversal probability especially when it comes from liquidity holes followed by clear buying into strength still holding a bearish lean overall into 26 and early 27. positioned with spy 2026 puts and exposure in cvna and arkk. already explained the reasoning in previous posts in the sub. not expecting anything specific off the open just being ready. if the same conditions line up i will post what i see after the open. just keeping it systematic and letting the market set the pace whats everyone thinking??",wallstreetbets,2025-04-07,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jthv06/watching_for_snapback_setups_off_gap_down_open/,"Features reversed 2-3% in the past few hours, it's getting interesting.",

PLTR: The Most Overvalued Stock in History,"While everyones focused on Nvidia as the most overvalued stock of this cycle, the real bubble is Palantir. Palantir is sitting at a price to sales ratio of 100, making it the most expensive large cap stock ever on a revenue basis. At an almost $300 billion market cap with 34% revenue growth and less than $3B in sales for all of 2024, the stocks valuation is completely disconnected from its fundamentals. Here's a table of the most overvalued large cap stocks I could find throughout history, sorted by date of the peak P/S ratio along with P/E a year later and change in revenue, EPS, and share price in the year following the peak valuation (I worked all weekend on this unfortunately): **Nvidia** Nvidias valuation was insane and the growth was even crazier. That was a once in lifetime growth story, and PLTR is somehow priced much higher. **Tesla** Teslas 1,400 P/E in 2021 looks insane but EPS exploded the next year and the valuation normalized. Palantir doesnt have anywhere close to that growth coming. **Cisco** Cisco is a better comparison. It crashed over 80% during the dotcom bubble pop and never returned to those levels. PLTR is more expensive with weaker growth and is somehow projected for less revenue growth than Cisco saw throughout that 80% stock decline. **Zoom** The closest comparison is Zoom, which peaked with a P/S of 106 in late 2020. Zoom went on to grow revenue at 170% and EPS at 319% over the next year. Despite that insane growth (much higher than what Palantir is projected to do), the stock still dropped 45% in that time, then bottomed nearly 90% from its highs. Palantir is trading at a similar valuation with significantly less growth. 2021 was also a euphoric market year, while were at the beginning of a market-wide bubble pop. Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods weve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidias peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS. **Conspiracies** Palantirs surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and Im 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either. Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didnt stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple. tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but its the next Cisco or Zoom. I have no idea how this stock is above $20 a share.",wallstreetbets,2025-05-05,1473,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kew2vw/pltr_the_most_overvalued_stock_in_history/,"Not gonna read that but based on the post title I'm gonna load up on callsYou know how a Hall throat pill is $0.02 when you buy them at Wal Mart but $12 if they give them to you at the hospital?

Everything about META's earnings tonight,"Meta is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts. Tesla generally moves 10%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand. As we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause ""a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025."" For the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart]( Advertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million. While Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the companys financial outlook for near future quarters. Metas enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025, said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights]( But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama. Debra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: We attribute weakness to [Metas] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (>10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend. In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter. In the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the companys various products, including Facebook and Instagram]( were given the ability to perform romantic role play even with the platforms teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit]( that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot. Keep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)]( in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the personal social networking. It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a ""buy-or-bury"" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try]( to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.]( Metas earnings call comes at a precarious time where the companys future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape, said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx]( He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing ""leaky bucket for Meta."" Zuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trumps inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related]( to the companys decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020. From what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush.

Hertz: Here's Why I'm Planning To Get In With OTM Puts,"# Summary of my Bear Case * The high short interest led to a spectacular rally following Bill Ackman's fund announcement of a 4.1% stake in the Hertz. * Bloomberg just announced (April 25) that the company is looking to raise $500 million through debt or (and this is key) **equity**. * I believe the company will dilute investors at the start of next week. That will probably lead to a selloff (like it is usually the case, after an equity offering). * I'm planning to buy OTM puts, with a price target of $5 over the next 2-3 months. I am not a degen (despite my profile name), so I need theta to be on my side, baby! * I believe Hertz could be cooked. Revenue is down, despite decent utilization rates. That means the company is renting cars at lower prices to keep demand. * Tariffs will most likely not improve its vehicle's residual values, as Trump may pause sectoral tariffs on autos. * Airlines have recently reported a decline in air travel. Considering that 65% of the company's revenue comes from airport locations, that is another headwind to consider. * Overall, I believe the AI / robotaxi infrastructure nonsense is not alligned with the company's simplification strategy. I have big doubts Bill Ackman will be able to pursue management into this business venture. # Fundamentals Both Americas and International revenues are down, yoy. Here is the yoy variation: Americas: * Q4 2024: -7.5% * Q3 2024: -5.1% * Q2 2024: -4.3% * Q1 2024: 0.5% International: * Q4 2024: -2.1% * Q3 2024: -3.2% * Q2 2024: 0.7% * Q1 2024: 7.6% Overall, worldwide vehicle rental revenue is down by -3.4% yoy in FY 2024. Big drop compared to the 20.6% increase in FY 2023 or the 56% increase in FY 2022. From a profitability perspective (EBIT**DA),** things look raw (to say the least). Just look at the trend below. By the way, that's earnings **BEFORE** depreciation. When taking into account DEPRECIATION, things look even more raw. What's the company doin' about this? **Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right** strategy --> Back to Basis roadmap Here's a summary: |Metric|Year-End 2023|Year-End 2024|Target by YE 2025| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |% of fleet 1 year old|(not disclosed)|60%|Substantially complete rotation\*| |Average cap cost of risk vehicles vs. existing|(not disclosed)|\~30% lower|Maintain or improve cost advantage| |Vehicles sold (Q4)|\~30,000|100,000 (+230%)|| |Depreciation per unit (DPU), net|Guided $350375|Actual $347 (**gross**)|<$300/month/unit| On the **Buy Right** strategy. From the Q4 earnigns call: >*Our risk vehicles have an average cap cost almost 30% lower than our existing fleet of model year 22 through 24 car buys* In plain English: Compared to the cars they bought in 20222024, the new cars (for 2025) cost 30% less on average. >*We've got committed model year '25 buys locked in at the economics that foot to that \[sub-$300 DPU\] metric* What is the DPU: depreciation per vehicle per month. In plain English: how much a vehicle looses value per month due to depreciation. The thing is. $300 DPU is not a sneeze. Take a look at the DPU trend below. Does that look scary? It seems that the depreciation in the US is way more pronounced than in the EU. Here's the deal, baby! The median of the ""total DPU"" since 2019 was **$253**. Things changed after the pandemic, you may say. Fair enough. Here is the median of the ""total DPU"" (total meaning both US and International cars) since Q1 2022: **$284.** Let me be clear. The target of <$300 per month is only bringing back the company to the base line after the pandemic. That baseline is still high compared to pre-pandemic levels. On their **Hold Right** strategy: A cars biggest value drop happens in the first 12 years. But if Hertz keeps cars very new (fleet mostly < 1 year old), depreciation per month becomes predictable and lower. From the earnings call: >As of year-end 2024, over 60 % of our fleet was comprised of vehicles 1 year old or less. On the **Sell Right** strategy: In Q4 2024 alone, they sold 100,000 vehicles, compared to just 30,000 in Q4 2023. Less than 10% sold in auctions (lower prices) and they are prioritizing their retail selling channel (higher prices due to add-ons, like financing). Management is bullish on tariffs: >If tariffs increase new car prices, the counterbalance is likely residual values will go up, which will help our business model I am not. Here is why: Trump is chickening out of sectoral tariffs on autos after CEOs complained. Check recent news on this topic. I am seemingly now allowed to post links. # The Bear Case Here is a strong pillar of my bear case: Take a look at utilization rates over past few years. Notice the seasonality, which is 100% normal. WTF is the utlization rate? In plain English: how much a vehicle is being rented (i.e. generating $$$) during the quarter. 80% utilization rate means that 4 out of 5 days, the car is rented out. Not bad, right! The trend looks fine. Here is the yoy variation in utilization rates: * Q4 2024: 1.3% * Q3 2024: -1.2% * Q2 2024: -2.4% * Q1 2024: -1.3% The trend (when adjusted for seasonality) is flat, which is great... or is it? Take a look at the trend in total revenue per transaction day. In other words, how much HTZ is makin' per vehicle per day, on average, during the quarter, both in Americans and Intl. The trend looks raw. Here's the thing: to keep the same utilization rates (in other words, to keep their vehicles rented out), the company has to lower the daily rates to maintain demand. Here is the seasonally adjusted variation in revenue per transaction day in 2024: * Q4 2024: -2.4% * Q3 2024: -0.7% * Q2 2024: -3.2% * Q1 2024: -6.9% Speaking of raw trends, here is a chart showing interest expenses over the past few years: Here is the yoy variation in interest payments: * Q4 2024: 19.3% * Q3 2024: 9.3% * Q2 2024: 26.1% * Q1 2024: 33.3% Here is an interesting chart of the nearest debt maturities: # The Pershing Square Deal Bill Ackman's fund owns now 4.1% of HTZ. Possibly the first step of an activist campaign to influence management on the direction of the company. (when they reach 5% ownership, the fund must file either a 13D or 13G). Morgan Stanley teased the AI case for the company. To my eyes, BS. Here is why: It seems that the Street is bullish on autonomous vehicles (i.e. robotaxis) requiring ""downstream fulfillment infrastructure"" that could be implemented at HTZ rental locations. Look. Hype works when the S&P 500 is hitting all time highs. Now, hype it's not a good bet. Tesla's robotaxies are operating on Tesla's own infrastructure. Same for Waymo. Hertz would need to burn a lot in CapEx to adapt their rental locations to accommodate robotaxis' operations. Not bullish, in my view. Here is another reason I am sketched out by the rally. And this, is the final pillar of my bear case: According to Bloomberg, Hertz Global Holdings is looking to raise $500M through additional debt **or equity offering.** This is key. This is a rumor. It's not officially announced by the company. There is no 8-K filed yet. My point: if the company dilutes investors now that the share price is up (which is quite common, just look at quantum stocks in Q4 last year), that will lead to a selloff. Simple as that. # Technical Analysis # Position I haven't bought puts yet. I may do on Monday, depending on price action and if the company files an 8-K with their potential offering before the market opens.

Everything about Google's earnings tonight,"Alphabet reports first-quarter earnings after today's closing bell. They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. So for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market. **The Chart** From a [TA perspective]( a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. **Earnings** For Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging. **Cloud Services** For those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively. The second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segments operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position. I'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and managements tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history]( However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024. **Tariffs** One of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the companys operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty. At this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks. I think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the companys operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during todays conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabets business. It is worth noting that this isnt necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabets clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the companys revenue. **Price Targets** Amid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet]( TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value. Guggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures. I mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts arent necessarily predicting more downside; theyre just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term. If were to simplify the analysts overall message, its that Alphabets fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy. **In the news** A federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest. Theres also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure. **Mergers and Acquisitions** Alphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Clouds security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers. Separately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment. **What now?** Alphabets stock may be down, but most analysts still believe its a long-term winner. Thats why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.",wallstreetbets,2025-04-24,251,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k70ero/everything_about_googles_earnings_tonight/,"I see great long term value, so I will be buying calls that expire tomorrowI almost sunk my entire 401k into Goog/googl yesterday but my order didn't execute since my limit price was a dime too low.

Checking the halving of Teslas Capital Expenditures together,"**Found the mistake: The accounting rules for the IRS are different than for public financial statements of US companies. Oooooffff, thought i got them** **Can be locked now.** For full disclosure: Yeah, i lost money on shorting this damn stock. But with this in mind, i got angry at the the shitshow and am now trying to understand the story of how it is possible that Teslas capital expenditures halved within a year and i would like your help with this, since i am not firm enough in the matter to know if i'm missing something. I already asked a cousin of mine at the german 'Finanzamt', the equivalent of the IRS to give me his take on it. He has yet to answer me. I particularly need your help in understanding how american capital allowances work and how long they are stretched for different items. Maybe i'm wrong and this is a nothingburger. I dunno. So, here is the thing: I got a serious problem with the way it's supposed to be possible that, on one hand the 'Abschreibungen' (Google translates this as 'Capital Allowances' to me) of a company that in the last five to seven years has built most of it's biggest production facilities and the way these are noted in their books. As i understand it, most of the capital allowances for the biggest items Tesla has to buy for the factories are, at least here in Germany, written off in a time span of 5 to 25 years, with the wide majority of items being written of after 7 for a lot of machinery, but expensive items like buildings often taking 20 to 25 years for the writeoff. If i understand it correctly, these costs appear as capital expenditures in Teslas books. Given that Tesla practically just built these factories, most of the capital expenditures should still be running. How is it possible that these costs simply 'disappear' from one year to the next? I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept that i'm not qualified to make assumptions over fraud here. But i'd really like to be presented a compelling argument on this. I don't understand how this should be possible, unless Tesla sold off major parts of their facilities and other inventory and then leased it back or something. Maybe i'm just stupid. But please explain this to me. Edit: I'm not sure if i got lost in translation here, but again, Google translated the word ""Abschreibung"" to me as capital allowance. So let me explain: If you are a business and buy certain, mostly expensive items, you can not simply write the costs for that into your books. Rather, you have to look up a long list of items and check the time the IRS gives you to use these until, theoretically, you have to buy a new one. This process is called ""Abschreibung"" in German. Maybe there is another term for this in English. Would be helpful if someone translates this correctly. Edit 2: So, one commenter noted that the terms used in the US are ""Depreciation, amortization and impairment"". I think those are not the terms used by the IRS and accountants, but they explain why capital allowance exists. Since an item can still be sold for a certain value for a certain time after it's bought, it does not immediately constitute costs, even if already paid. Authorities instead calculate the costs of that item by a theoretical meassure in which it 'depreciates' in value when used for the production process, which is time. I guess the IRS, in the same way as our ""Finanzamt"", has a long list of items, from computers, over cars, to buildings, that have a specific number of years to be cleared from the books as costs. If a building, for example, has 25 years to be cleared, it means that, once bought, this building will show up as capital expenditure for 25 years after. So: It takes years to clear these from Teslas books. How then can half these costs be gone within a year? **Found the mistake: The accounting rules for the IRS are different than for public financial statements of US companies. Oooooffff, thought i got them** **Can be locked now.**",wallstreetbets,2025-04-24,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k6dp17/checking_the_halving_of_teslas_capital/,"When a company cuts CapEx its usually because they know theyre in for hard times and need to preserve capital.

The Market didn't care about Tesla's Earnings. Here's why. TLDR? It's not rigged,"Everyones tripping out about why Tesla is ripping after awful earnings, so heres whats actually going on, and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks. Tesla reported after hours. Margins are down, revenue is weak, guidance is fuzzy, and Elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech, tariffs are bad, cheaper cars, robots making cars.... But instead of tanking, the stock jumped. Why? Short answer: markets dont just trade the news, they trade positioning and expectations. Heres how it works: Before earnings, implied volatility (IV) was high. That means options, especially puts, were expensive. Everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop. If you bought puts, you and everyone else were betting Tesla would move more than the expected range. But Tesla didnt crash. It didnt even dip. It went up. So tomorrow morning, we will likely see IV crush when IV drops hard after earnings. Thats where Vega comes in. Vega measures how much an options price changes in relation to its implied volatility (IV). If youre holding puts, and IV collapses, those options lose value quickly, even if Tesla trades in your direction or sideways. Now lets talk about the feedback loop; this is where things get interesting. Market makers (dealers) are usually on the other side of all those puts. If they sell you a put, theyre taking on directional risk; if Tesla drops, they lose. So to protect themselves, they hedge. For puts, that means shorting the stock to stay neutral. If the stock drops, their short hedge offsets their option losses. But if the stock doesnt drop, or even worse, it goes up, they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked. That buying pushes the stock price higher. And as the stock goes higher, they need to buy more to stay hedged. Thats a gamma feedback loop. Add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop, and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself, even if the earnings were bad. But it doesnt mean the move is real or sustainable. The big dogs (institutions) havent even acted yet. Theyll dissect the call overnight and into the next day. Some might sell the rip. Some might rebalance slowly over a few days. The real move sometimes doesnt hit until later. Lets be real, this game isnt just about puts and calls. Market makers, hedge funds, and institutional players have access to insane levels of data. They have entire teams of quants, analysts, PhDs, and machines that track options flow, gamma exposure, CBOE positioning, bond yields, Fed swaps, commodities, FX correlations; you name it. They dont just trade the headlines; they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines. They model the crowds behavior before the crowd even makes a move. If this were as simple as bad earnings = buy puts, everyone would be rich. But its not. The options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market. Thats why insider trading is illegal, and why billionaires get into politics, to legally front-run the economy and gain access to real-time information that actually moves markets. Thats why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure, skew, delta hedging zones, not because its nice to have, but because its necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem. Yeah, some retail traders make big money, sometimes, but thats gambling. Without context, youre flipping a coin. This wasnt about fundamentals. It was about positioning, hedging mechanics, and options flow. The market punished the crowded trade, as it always does. So no, the system isnt rigged. Its just math, flow, and positioning. The market punishes the crowded trade. Too many people bet on a collapse, so the opposite happened. Welcome to the dealers game.",wallstreetbets,2025-04-23,6460,https://i.redd.it/ffoy3bji8jwe1.png,"TLDR the game isn't rigged in the sense of someone is acting to fuck you, it's acting exactly as intended, which is to fuck you.LOL if you swap all the words to the opposite (ie puts to calls and drops to rise) then the narrative will sound perfectly fine too. If its that simple, then you just always buy against the sentiment and easy money according to OP. Until it doesnt.TLDR we watch this guy say the game isn't rigged then has at least one paragraph talking about how lobbies and the ultra rich ""lead the market"" and use politics to push it around. That's the rigged part you dope.These reeks a bit of fitting a narrative to what happened in hindsight. But this isn't a normal stock I guess.

Everything about Tesla's earnings tonight,"Tesla is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts. Tesla generally moves 10%, and shot up last two earnings but down badly the one prior in July 2024. For tonight's first-quarter earnings and revenue, from what I've read, it looks like a lot of analysts are *already* predicting poor results. They see see EPS down 9% to 41 cents a share, though more recent forecasts point to a further slide. Revenue should fall a fraction to $21.27 billion, with the sharp consensus pointing to a 7% decline to $19.76 billion. Tesla Q1 consensus earnings projections have come down more than 40% since the end of 2024. The Q1 EPS target was $3.31 just before Tesla's Q4 earnings release. What's interesting is that in Q4, Tesla's net income was boosted by a recent change in how companies account for holdings of digital currencies. This policy change resulted in an earnings per share add-on of 68 cents in Q4, with a net income increase of $600 million. So the price of corn could actually really influence the results today. [The company delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1]( down 13% vs. a year earlier and the lowest since Q2 2022. They fell 32.1% vs. Q4's record 495,570 EVs. The bright spot is Tesla China, where sales appeared to edge higher vs. a year earlier, but those tend to be lower margin. U.S. and European sales have tumbled on Musk's brand woes. Tesla also deployed 10.4 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in Q1, down slightly vs. Q4's record 11 GWh but up 156% vs. a year earlier. I've looked at a few articles regarding EVs, it looks like auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits of 13.1%, compared to 16.4% a year ago. The average selling price per vehicle coming in at $37,910 in Q1, down from $43,790 in Q1 2024. So this is what I'm expecting for today: As usual, the focus will be on Elon and the earnings call. Tesla is also changing things up and have said ""in addition to posting first quarter results"" it ""will hold a live company update and question and answer"" session. What this means is anybody's best guess. He in the past has repeatedly said earnings calls are not for product announcements. Could this mean he'll give significant details on the new affordable vehicle? Or could it be similar to the recent all-hands company meeting where he told employees to hold onto their Tesla stock, touting the future of artificial intelligence and robotics? In any case, I'm more-so interested to see if he sticks to his forecast for unsupervised, self-driving ride hailing in Austin this June, any details about the ""affordable"" vehicle, if he sees delivery growth in 2025 after a weak Q1 and sluggish start to April and what are his plans around his work with the Trump White House. Honestly all this Trump stuff has seemingly [hurt sales]( and dropped the stock. But there isn't really much we can know about the precise impact on Teslas bottom line until tonight. It's already been reported that Tesla will delay its upcoming ""affordable"" EV by at least three months. Tesla had said it planned production of a lower-cost vehicle by mid-year, but various reports had suggested it would come in late 2025 or 2026. The latest report said production will start in the U.S., followed by China and Europe. They have not given any details about the EV, but multiple reports have said it'll be a stripped-down Model Y rather than a new form factor, like a hatchback. I honestly think he needs to leave government and be a full-time CEO for Tesla. Right now his temporary status as a government employee expires next month, so he will face questions about his plans during the call. He really needs to lay out the timeline/hard facts around the rollout of autonomous vehicles and robotics over the next 6-12 months. I want answers on when the new lower cost vehicle will hit the production line. Honestly, if he chooses to stay with the government it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Not good. In addition to this, rival automakers saw huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on April 2. Tesla's main rival overseas, BYD, has been eating into Tesla's market share for some time now. So with this, I'm considering puts or a put spread. Considering the stock is up 6%, puts are at a discount now. Since the stock usually goes up or down 10%, I would target the 230 or 225 strike price with 4/25 exp date.

Forecasting Tesla's Earnings Q&A,"Tuesday evening, Tesla will release it's Q1 2025 earnings. Professional analysts have put in a lot of work to try to predict how the numbers will come out, and if you're interested in that sort of thing, you can find it easily on Google. Instead, I'm going to try to forecast how Tesla management will handle the Q&A portion of the event. Some of the questions will come live from professional analystsbut Tesla has also indicated they will respond to [questions from retail investors submitted and voted on via the Say app]( So I'm going to look at the current top-voted six questions. Tesla may not address every single one of them, but I expect them to try to answer most of them. **TLDR; It's clear even relatively bullish Tesla investors have serious concerns about the company, and Tesla management is going to have a difficult time reassuring them during the earnings call.** Anyway, here are the questions: >When will FSD unsupervised be available for personal use on personally-owned cars? This is current top-voted question on Say, which is a little surprising, because I think it's a pretty safe bet that Tesla's management will decline to make any predictions. Perhaps Elon Musk will blame people's alleged irrational fear of self-driving cars, as he did in Tesla's previous earnings call, where he complained that, ""if somebody scrapes that shin with an autonomous car, it's headline news"". There's another reason for Tesla to refuse to make promises though: there's simply no evidence Tesla's self-driving tech has caught up to where Waymo was several years ago. More on that below. >Is Tesla still on track for releasing more affordable models this year? Or will you be focusing on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck? Here, again, I think we can predict fairly confidently what Tesla will say: they're going with somewhat cheaper variants of existing models (the new Cybertruck is ""only"" about $70,000). But I understand why Tesla investors want this question answeredduring Tesla's earnings call for Q1 2024, it was hinted that the company would be introducing a *much* less expensive model to compete with budget EV models offered by companies like Nissan and Kia. The prospect was greeted with enthusiasm by investors. Now, however, those investors are going to want to see Tesla deliver. Unfortunately, if the plan for a new, cheaper Tesla model were ever on track, they've probably have been completely derailed by Trump's tariffs. In fact, just yesterday [Reuters released a story about just how big of a problem the new tariffs are for Tesla]( Some may see a silver lining in that tariffs should also make Nissans and Kias much more expensive, but I'm not sure Tesla will even *try* to make that argument. Musk himself has said tariffs will have a [""significant""]( impact on Tesla, and I think he means it. >How is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic risks in the form of tariffs, political biases, etc.? This question gets to tariffs directly. Tesla management will no doubt try to offer some hopeperhaps pointing out that the situation is still up in the air to a significant extentbut it's going to be hard to sugarcoat the situation. I'm not exactly sure what the questioner means by ""political biases"", but stick a pin in it, because it's not the only highly-voted question that mentions politics. >Does Tesla still have a battery supply constraint (noted on Q4 ER call) and how does this change w/tariffs? This references a comment Musk made in the previous earnings call about battery production, rather than demand, being the biggest constraint on Tesla sales. It seems quite likely this is no longer truebecause demand is down! That said, the reporting I've read on how tariffs will affect Tesla hasn't mentioned battery production *specifically* as an area where tariffs will really hurt. >Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of brand damage? It is extremely weird that this question is framed in terms of ""rumors"", because, to be clear, this is what we are talking about: *Processing img 1hmigczcybve1...* The above scene is currently playing out somewhere on the order of a hundred, two hundred times *per week* across the country. In terms of what would be good for Tesla's stock price Wednesday morning after earnings, probably the best possible thing that could happen is that Musk uses the earnings call to announce that he's stepping down from the Trump administration and devoting his full attention to Tesla. Personally, I'm not sure this would actually solve Tesla's problems, but I think lots of investors think it would. However, it seems unlikely Musk will step down from his role in the Trump administration in the foreseeable future. Two weeks ago, when Politico reported Musk was leaving the Trump administration, both Musk and the White House [quickly denounced the story as ""fake news""]( Furthermore, Musk's [X feed]( is still in full MAGA mode, giving absolutely no indication he regrets anything about his political activities. The best-case scenario here (again, from a Tesla shareholder point of view) is probably that we get some spin about how given X, Y, and Z, Tesla's Q1 delivery numbers are actually better than people realize. A claim of that sort will probably be met with skepticism from many investors, but it beats Musk going on a rant how he's the target of a vast criminal conspiracy funded by George Soros. The latter possibility is not one I'd necessarily bet much money on, but it's also hard not to wonder about given the current state of Musk's X account. And last but certainly not least: >Robotaxi still on track for this year? For context, in his opening remarks for Tesla's most recent earnings call, Musk said ""We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, full self-driving in Austin in June."" Then, during the Q&A section, the very first question, submitted via the Say app, specifically asked about unsupervised FSD in California, to which Musk replied, ""I'm confident that we'll release unsupervised FSD California this year as well"". Finally, when an analyst asked about how the company will know whether or not it's on the right track in 12 months, Musk went even further: ""I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in North America, at least. I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it's likely to be just regulatory."" I expect Musk to have to walk this rhetoric back next week. Maybe only slightlymaybe ""this year"" becomes ""by end of year or early next year"". But it still won't exactly be the news investors are hoping to hear. The trouble here is that there's simply no evidence Tesla has figured out how to make self-driving cars that can operate safely without human supervision. It's possible Tesla really will try to take advantage of a ~~lax~~ friendly regulatory environment in Texas to launch a taxi service in Austin fairly soonbut even then, it seems likely these taxis will be [teleoperated, not unsupervised]( (Musk's equivocation between ""unsupervised"" and ""no one in the car"" has been [noted by Tesla watchers]( Worse, there's no indication Tesla has made *any* progress on launching robotaxis outside Texas[misleading hype about getting a chauffeur license in California]( notwithstanding. In short, a lot of investors are going to be going into this earnings call looking for reassurance from Tesla. And I just don't think the company can give it to them. *Processing img nn0psmti8cve1...*",wallstreetbets,2025-04-17,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k1dbj3/forecasting_teslas_earnings_qa/,"We live in a bizarre 1984 doublespeak world where Tesla's brand damage is ""rumor"" even as the President of the US is declaring that messing with Teslas is ""terrorism""All itll take is for musk to hop on a call and say hes now more committed than ever after stepping away from doge etc and itll pump 35% overnight.Counterpoint to your positions: last earnings TSLA was also in a pile of shit and they missed numbers but musk pulled some shit out of his ass and it pumped it had gone down the weeks prior and everyone was expecting a miss, so it pumped this situation rings similar to me. has gone down last couple weeks and everyone is expecting shit news. so somehow it will pumpRumour has it that Elon will announce the Tesla FCoffee, a coffee machine that can suck you off and walk your dog.

"Tesla bull slashes stock price target 43%, citing Musk and Trump","[ (Bloomberg) One of Wall Streets most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trumps trade policies. Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst whos rated the carmakers shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty. Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Ives biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US presidents tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinpings government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trumps so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products. This will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others, Ives said in his note issued Sunday. We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate. Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances. The stock has fallen 50% from its record high reached Dec. 17.",wallstreetbets,2025-04-06,2995,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jt1wa9/tesla_bull_slashes_stock_price_target_43_citing/,"TSLA currently 239.43 (50% down from ATH) Daniel Ive slashed from 550 to 315\>Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally...It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.

Tesla troubles: European business is getting worse as sales slump in April,"Teslas ([TSLA]( troubles in Europe are going from bad to worse. The latest data out of the UK found Tesla registrations (a proxy for sales) hit only 512 new vehicles in April, per the[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]( trade group. That figure is down 62% from a year earlier; meanwhile, Chinese EV maker BYD's[(BYDDY)]( surged over 650% to 2,511 units. Teslas UK underperformance follows weakness in other key regions. Germanys[KBA trade group reported]( dipped 46% in the country to 885. The country is home to Teslas only European factory. BYD saw its German registrations jump over 755% to 1,566 units. Tesla registrations also fell in key territories like France (down 59%), Denmark (down 67%), and Sweden (down 81%), per Bloomberg data polling national auto associations. The drops in April mirror[tumbling European sales in March]( well. Tesla shares were down 2% in early trade on Tuesday. Tesla bulls attribute depressed demand to the new Model Y changeover, which also resulted in a production slowdown. However, the EV maker began deliveries of the new Model Y, although only for the all-wheel drive version, in European regions like Germany in March. Whether those deliveries ramped up to a higher volume is unclear at this point. But what is clear is that the new Model Y is available for delivery. Two factors are of greater concern to Tesla in Europe. The ramping up of BYD sales in European territories is eating into Tesla sales in several European countries. In addition, even legacy automakers like Volkswagen ([VOW.DE]( ([F]( and Fiat saw sales gains in April. The other big factor: CEO Elon Musk and his polarizing behavior. Musk's closeness to President Trump and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe have had an impact on Tesla's brand.[Protests, for instance, at Tesla showrooms in the US]( abroad are ongoing. Also, owners are trading in their vehicles at alarming rates, leading to[falling prices in the secondary market]( With Teslas brand suffering and sales sliding in Q1, Musk said on the companys[latest earnings call]( he would be allocating far more of his time to Tesla. That move by Musk to promise a curtailing of activity in Washington in order to increase time at Teslas Austin HQ comes as the Tesla board may have reached a breaking point. The[Wall Street Journal]( last week that Teslas board of directors was in the initial stages of a formal process to find the EV makers next CEO. The board, according to the Journal, also told Musk he needed to spend more time back at the company and needed to let Tesla investors and the public know he was returning. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm categorized the story as absolutely false, but analysts believe the showdown between Musk and the board was very tense before Musk very publicly vowed to spend more time at Tesla.

"Tesla sees steep sales drops in April across Europe: 81% in Sweden, 75% in Netherlands, 67% in Denmark, and 59% in France","Tesla ([TSLA]( is[feeling the chill in Europe]( Its April sales plummeted across key markets like France and Denmark, as political controversy and growing competition weigh on the brand. In France, Tesla sold just 863 vehicles last month a 59.4% year-over-year drop and its fourth straight monthly decline. Sales in Denmark were even worse, falling 67.2% to only 180 vehicles. Year-to-date, Tesla's France sales are down nearly 44%, compared to a 7.3% dip in the overall market. It's not just about cars anymore. Tesla's limited model lineup is facing heat from new and cheaper electric vehicles especially from Chinese brands. But it's CEO Elon Musk's politics that may be burning hotter. His outspoken support of President Trump has sparked protests across Europe, including vandalism at Tesla showrooms and charging stations. Many consumers appear to be voting with their wallets. Tesla's European slump adds to a rough quarter. In Q1, the company's auto revenue dropped 20%, and net income plunged 71%, both missing expectations. April's data suggests the pain may continue into Q2. More European data is expected soon, but for now, the signs point to a rocky road ahead especially if brand perception continues to slide.

(05/1) Interesting Stocks Today - Unemployment gets Worse,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. Tariff news expected by the end of the day from the White House. News: [Weekly jobless claims surge to 241,000]( [**TSLA (Tesla)**]( Tesla chair denied reports of a search for a new CEO to replace Elon Musk, reaffirming the companys commitment to its current leadership structure. This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well. [**RBLX (Roblox)**]( Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux! [**MSFT (Microsoft)**]( EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). [**META (Meta)**]( Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments.

What are corporate insiders doing with the Mag 7?,"The Mag 7 lost momentum and have seriously lagged this year. ""Dumb money"" (retail investors) have been bag holding, while institutions unloaded early. In some cases, they are starting to buy back in. But what are the actual corporate insiders doing? Generally, corporate insiders tend to have more net selling activity than buying, because their compensation is generally in the form of stock. That being said, disproportionate selling without buying is somewhat of a red flag. On the contrary, insider buying is a good sign that the leadership believes their stocks are undervalued.

Heres my thesis:","""Smart Money"" if we can still call it ""smart money,"" it's certainly not buying Tesla stock right now. Institutions and market makers are well aware that Teslas numbers came in worse than expected. They know the numbers arent likely to improve in the coming quarters, especially with the looming threat of a recession, a growing global boycott of Tesla vehicles in Canada, Europe, and China, and the significant impact of tariffs on production costs. Their strategy now is to offload their positions discreetly while encouraging the broader marketthe massesto buy in. Once retail investors convince themselves that the worst is over and start ""buying the dip,"" thats when the so-called smart money will show its hand. By then, we could see TSLA drop below $200.

Where does the TSLA hopium come from?,"Yesterday, Tesla reported one of their worst earnings in recent years. Despite the negative downturn, the stock is somehow *up* 10%. I know everyone always says Tesla doesnt trade on fundamentalsit trades on vibes, dreams of the future, and of course, the Elon effect. The bullish case on TSLA pre-earnings seemed to hinge on two things: 1. Elon would gracefully bow out of his political sideshow, and 2. Hed unveil some new miracle product or project that could maybe resurrect Jesus himself and deliver him in a Cybertruck Neither happened. Instead, Elon said hes sticking around at DOGE until Trumps presidency is over (specifically mentioning another 4 years). There was no shiny new productjust a warning of bumps in the road, increased production costs, and doubling down on the delay of their affordable car and robotaxi. Oh, and lets not forget the continued brand damage apparently caused by paid protestors. So... where is this hopium coming from? **Cathie Woods dream journal?**",StockMarket,2025-04-23,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1k69czu/where_does_the_tsla_hopium_come_from/,"Not sure why Elon returning to Tesla would be considered good news. I strongly doubt his customer base is just going to suddenly forget about all of his ""antics"" regarding the government & DOGE and his ""salutes"". Also I feel like I read before folks saying that they had a specific team of people to distract him because he would put his nose up too many people's business & slow things down, but I'm not sure on that. I'd wager Trump & Bessent's announcements that they will be nice to China & the tariffs won't be as high as 145% were made specifically during this time to distract for Tesla's abysmal earnings. I'd wager TSLA will probably be back down to at least $220 within a weekIt's been overvalued for years...and it's still overvalued. At some point it's like, is there really a difference between it being 1000% overvalued and it being 1200% overvalued? Everyone is going to lose their shirts on it eventually, just a matter of whenIt's the hope of the automated driving and the battery technology. But it does appear to be all hopes and promises and dreams with no execution, which is why I have never dabbled with Tesla, but right now it does seem like way more of a sell than a buy. The brand is toxic.",
Some Thoughts on $TSLA Performance,"In Q4 2023, the automaker reports diluted earnings of $2.27 per share. Q4 2024, we are at $0.66 per share. One quarter later in Q1 2025, we are at $0.12 per share on a diluted basis. Over this time, the EBITDA margin has remained around \~10-12%. What can we gather from this? Tesla is aggressively capitalizing R&D and SG&A costs to the balance sheet rather than passing them through the P&L. Their earnings are actually much worse than their financial statements would suggest at the facial level today. The cash flows reveal the truth in this case... free cash flow margins have averaged below 4% during the last 8 quarters. The business is not generating new cash for reinvestment any better than their counterparts at Ford even though Ford, in this timespan, has been trying to stand up a brand new EV business where TSLA already has one in place. My position is that TSLA is, at best, obfuscating the truth of their hemorrhaging operations to their investors. Their returns on the capital they employ within the business are, in several quarters, lower than the APY their investors could get on a HYSA. And that is without taking into account the effect of deflating the asset base by pushing at least half of what they are ""capitalizing"" in a very aggressive way back to earnings, which I feel is the most prudent way to analyze the true efficiency in this firm. TSLA is an automaker, not a pure play software company. It isn't that the majority of their expenses can possibly be fit to be capitalized and amortized over ""X"" amount of years. This is a convenient way to hide the level of economic value destruction that is happening, but not all that difficult to uncover by analyzing the P&L and balance sheet across periods to see exactly what it is they are doing to maintain the appearance of profitability. This business, without dispute, has enormous fixed costs, and they no longer have enough sales to spread those across today.",StockMarket,2025-04-23,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1k64yuj/some_thoughts_on_tsla_performance/,I wonder if we will see more negative news as more people digest the earnings. It going up after that earnings report is crazy.,
Musk on Trump tariffs: I'm an advocate for 'free trade and lower tariffs',"[ On Teslas ([TSLA]( first quarter earnings call last night, CEO Elon Musk reiterated one clear distinction between him and President Trump: He views tariffs as bad. Ive been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the president of the United States, Musk said in his opening remarks. So, you know, Ill continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but thats all I can do. Later on, when prodded by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas about comments Musk made about ramping up tariffs in the past (as opposed to immediate imposition), Musk added: Im an advocate of, you know, predictable tariff structures, and generally, Im an advocate for, you know, free trade and lower tariffs. But now one does need to take a look at where, you know, if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or is providing extreme support. Prior to President Trumps ""Liberation Day"" event, where he imposed tariffs across the board on many countries (before quickly backtracking), Musk and other White House officials lobbied the president not to go through with a punitive tariff structure. While Musk is a strong Trump supporter, hes also an operator, and tariffs on foreign imports and critical supply chain parts would be devastating for the company, even one that claims to have localized most of its supply chain and is around 85% USMCA compliant. In[its Q1 report]( Tesla blamed trade uncertainty as a reason behind slumping sales, though some believe Musk's other political activities, like running DOGE,[may have blunted demand]( ""Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,"" the company said in a statement. ""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term."" Because of this uncertainty, Tesla said it would revisit its 2025 guidance in its second quarter financial update and removed its long-term growth forecast. Wall Street analysts weighed in on the Trump tariff impact on Teslas various businesses, noting, as Tesla did, that tariffs would hurt more than just the auto business. ""The key \[trade\] headwinds are: (1) Energy business is disproportionally affected by tariffs as TSLA sources the LFP batteries from China, (2) Volume guidance was temporarily paused due to tariff uncertainty, (3) China restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are employed in permanent magnets for electric motors, may negatively affect Tesla's business; (4) A relevant portion of manufacturing equipment is sourced from China,"" BofA analyst John Murphy noted in a research report. Despite these issues, other analysts, like William Blairs Jed Dorsheimer, noted Teslas best house on the Tariff block status, due to localized production. Musk was candid about his advice to President Trump against tariffs and how Tesla would be significantly impacted; however, we see Tesla as the best house on a bad block, Dorsheimer said. Teslas are the most made-in-America vehicles of any OEM, and vertical integration and localized supply chains at each of its Giga factories make it the most robust to tariffs in the sector. That being said, Dorsheimer added Tesla is still dependent on the macro environment, and this made Treasury Secretary Scott Bessents comments about deescalation and diplomacy all the more important. Such is the nature of Trumps trade war that Musk may have found a strange bedfellow in Bessent, a hedge fund exec and former partner of liberal financier George Soros, a frequent bogeyman for Musk.",StockMarket,2025-04-23,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1k64ftd/musk_on_trump_tariffs_im_an_advocate_for_free/,"Yeah, he was also a free speech absolutist before he bought Twitter and the ability to suppress peoples speechYou're an advocate for whatever suits you best at any given time, Elon.

"Interesting Stocks Today (04/23) - Trump plans to be ""very nice"" to China!","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. Trump says he's going to be nice to China??? News: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks]( [**TSLA (Tesla)**]( Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels. [**SPY**]( **/** [**QQQ**]( **/** [**VXX**]( **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind. [**LLY (Eli Lilly)**]( lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them. [**HTZ (Hertz)**]( potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints. Policy reversals may alter this dynamic. Tariff policy changes could reduce used car prices, impacting Hertz's asset valuations and market volatility may affect rental demand. **Earnings today:** IBM",StockMarket,2025-04-23,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1k5ytsz/interesting_stocks_today_0423_trump_plans_to_be/,,

"[Insider Trading] Data Analysis for April 10, 2025 (Last 12 Hours) in the Context of Global Markets and Sector Performance","# Market Context Global markets experienced a significant sell-off on April 10, 2025: * **S&P 500 Futures (ES=F)**: Closed at 5,298.00, down 3.78% from 5,506.25 on April 9. * **Dow Jones Futures (YM=F)**: Dropped to 39,760.00 from 40,891.00, a 2.77% decline. * **VIX (\^VIX)**: Surged to 43.99 from 32.92, a 33.63% increase, indicating heightened volatility. * **Shanghai Composite (000001.SS)**: Bucked the trend, rising 1.16% to 3,223.64.

The updated time frame (shifted from 1:00 PM EST, or 10:00 AM PDT, to 18:30 PDT) potentially includes additional transactions up to 18:30 PDT. # Technology Sector * **Market Performance**: The sector saw significant declines, with major stocks like NVDA (-5.91%), META (-6.74%), and AAPL (-4.24%) reflecting broad selling pressure. * **Insider Activity**: * **Phreesia (PHR)**: Multiple executives sold shares: * CEO Chaim Indig: Sold $290,218. * SVP David Linetsky: Sold $99,990. * COO Evan Roberts: Sold $172,527. * General Counsel Allison Hoffman: Sold $252,777. * CFO Balaji Gandhi: Sold $191,895. * **Total**: Approximately $1.16 million. * **Note**: While web results mention a CFO sale on March 29, 2025 (outside our window), these transactions are assumed to fall within the last 12 hours based on the provided data. * **Implication**: Coordinated sales by top executives suggest caution, possibly due to sector headwinds or company-specific concerns. * **Cloudflare (NET)**: CEO Matthew Prince sold $249,015 and an additional $16 million in stock: * **Total**: Approximately $16.25 million. * **Implication**: This substantial sale could indicate profit-taking or unease about further sector declines, though it may also reflect a pre-planned trading schedule. * **Asana (ASAN)**: CEO Dustin Moskovitz bought shares in two transactions: * $6.7 million and $6.72 million. * **Total**: Approximately $13.42 million. * **Implication**: This significant purchase signals strong confidence in Asanas future, viewing the sectors sell-off as a buying opportunity. # Energy Sector * **Market Performance**: Energy stocks declined sharply (e.g., XOM -5.55%, CVX -7.57%). * **Insider Activity**: * **CVR Energy (CVI)**: Activist investor Carl Icahn acquired 665,449 shares from April 8 to April 10, 2025, totaling approximately $11.1 million: * **Specific to April 10**: The portion of this purchase on April 10 falls within the 12-hour window (exact breakdown unspecified but confirmed active on this date per web results). * **Context**: CVR Energys stock has dropped over 50% in the past year, positioning it as a potential value play. * **Implication**: Icahns contrarian buy suggests he sees upside potential, possibly anticipating a sector recovery or company-specific catalysts. # Consumer Cyclical Sector * **Market Performance**: The sector weakened, with stocks like TSLA declining 7.27%. * **Insider Activity**: * **Rush Street Interactive (RSI)**: Multiple insiders sold shares: * CEO Richard Schwartz: Sold $2.06 million. * CIO Einar Roosileht: Sold $111,600. * COO Mattias Stetz: Sold $14,676. * **Total**: Approximately $2.19 million. * **Implication**: These sales align with sector struggles, potentially reflecting concerns about consumer spending or industry-specific risks. # Other Notable Transactions * **Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO) - Communication Services**: Insider Arturo Moreno bought $1.73 million: * **Implication**: Optimism about advertising recovery or company growth amid sector declines (e.g., META -6.74%). * **Gamestop (GME) - Consumer Cyclical**: Director Alain Attal bought $257,500: * **Implication**: Suggests belief in a potential rebound or undervaluation. * **RenovoRx (RNXT) - Healthcare**: VP Controller Ronald Kocak and CMO Agah Ramtin bought shares totaling \~$34,399: * **Implication**: Modest buys in a smaller-cap biotech indicate confidence amid mixed sector performance. # Key Insights and Implications 1. **Technology Sector**: Mixed signals emerge, with significant sells at Phreesia and Cloudflare indicating caution, contrasted by Asanas large buy suggesting selective optimism. The sectors 4-7% declines may reflect valuation concerns or macroeconomic pressures, but Asanas CEO sees value. 2. **Energy Sector**: Icahns $11.1 million purchase of CVR Energy stock (partially on April 10) is a standout contrarian move. With the sector down sharply and CVR Energy off 50% in the past year, this buy could signal a bet on recovery or activist strategy. 3. **Consumer Cyclical Sector**: Insider sales at Rush Street Interactive reinforce the sectors weakness, hinting at worries about consumer demand or competitive pressures. 4. **Extended Time Window**: Shifting from 10:00 AM PDT (1:00 PM EST) to 18:30 PDT extends the analysis by 8.5 hours, potentially capturing more transactions. For instance, Icahns April 10 purchase is confirmed within this period, while earlier transactions (e.g., 16 minutes ago from 13:00 PDT) remain relevant if within the 06:30-18:30 PDT range. 5. **Volatility Context**: The VIX at 43.99 highlights market uncertainty. Sells in struggling sectors may reflect risk aversion, while buys could indicate insiders exploiting perceived overreactions. # Conclusion As of 18:30 PDT on April 10, 2025, insider trading activity over the last 12 hours reveals a cautious stance in Technology and Consumer Cyclical sectors, with significant sells at Phreesia, Cloudflare, and Rush Street Interactive aligning with their sectors poor performance. Conversely, notable buys in Technology (Asana) and Energy (CVR Energy) suggest some insiders see value amid the sell-off. With the VIX at 43.99 signaling high volatility, investors should weigh these insider signals carefully alongside broader market trends. The updated time frame to 18:30 PDT broadens the scope of transactions considered, reinforcing the mixed sentiment in this turbulent market environment.",StockMarket,2025-04-11,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jweej4/insider_trading_data_analysis_for_april_10_2025/,,

A diminished Magnificent 7 tests Big Techs role in the market,"Even before the stock market strapped into the tariff roller coaster,[Big Tech was on a bumpy ride]( The start of the year coincided with an unwinding of the AI trade. Trillion-dollar tickers composing the Magnificent Seven devolved from Wall Streets jet fuel into dead weight. Some forecasters lowered their S&P 500 year-end levels,[weighed down by the leaden baggage]( the Maleficent Seven,"" including the massive costs of AI development, Deepseeks surprise success, and what (at the time) was the looming threat of new levies. But as the AI trade cooled, the Magnificent Seven still tracked the growth trajectory of the market, even accounting for their concentration in the S&P 500. It wasnt (and still isnt) a controversial thing to say that many of the valuations of the largest companies were inflated by a combination of AI mania, FOMO trading, and the animal spirits wafting around talk of a soft landing. Fast-forward a few weeks and several panicked trading sessions later, and the Magnificent Seven has been cut down to size. But[the relief that arrived this week]( though fleetingly measured in hours on Tuesday, highlighted just how important these stocks remain, [even in their diminished state](",StockMarket,2025-04-09,21,https://i.redd.it/vv1ru44pmste1.png,,
China didn't call,,StockMarket,2025-04-09,4618,https://i.redd.it/o05d6w7vxrte1.jpeg,"the best scenery would be all globe countries turning their back on mango and not going to try to make any deal, this would make u.s. implode and finally remove mango from oval office, but is just a dream that will never happen.Any bookmaker to place bets of China calling or not ?The 10-year Treasury yield has been volatile recently, rising to 4.17% on April 1 and then surging to 4.166% on April 7 despite concerns about economic downturn, before falling below 4% on April 4 to 3.97%, its lowest level since October 2024. Meanwhile, the 2-year Treasury yield has dropped to around 3.753% as of April 7, reaching its lowest point since September 2022, with markets pricing in more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts due to anticipated economic weakness from President Trumps tariff announcements. A weaker yuan can make Chinese exports cheaper for foreign buyers, helping counteract the price increases from U.S. tariffs and maintain export competitiveness. China might do this by allowing its currency to depreciate naturally or through domestic fiscal and monetary stimulus to cushion the economic blow from trade restrictions. Selling U.S. Treasury bonds typically strengthens the yuan if the proceeds are converted back. Doing this is usually more related to managing foreign exchange reserves or diversifying assets rather than directly weakening the currency to fight tariffs. For those who have a hard time following, picture it this way: 1. China owns lots of US bonds, which are like special IOUs from the US government paid in US dollars ($). 2. When China sells these US bonds, it gets US dollars ($) back. 3. Now, China has a pile of US dollars ($). If China wants to use this money back home, it needs to swap those dollars ($) for its own money, Chinese Yuan (). 4. To swap dollars for Yuan, China has to buy Yuan using its dollars. 5. Imagine lots of people suddenly wanting to buy apples. The price of apples would go up, right? Its the same here. When China uses its dollars ($) to buy lots of Yuan (), it increases the demand for Yuan. 6. Increased demand makes the Yuan more valuable, or stronger, compared to the dollar. Powell is a clown in a suit right now from Trump. He could turn water into wine and the market would still crash. April 9-10 alone are likely to trigger significant stock market dips due to the confluence of the EUs tariff response announcement, FOMC minutes release, Chinas retaliatory tariff implementation, and critical inflation data which is all occurring during already heightened market volatility.Old quote that ""most people would be mortified if they knew what an idiots are people who ruling them""(im butchering quote of Talleyrand iirc) never was so true Cause even if you go trough all the mental gymnastics and assume there were some plan for protectionism and to incentivize local manufacturing - whatever happening is clearly not it, not in slightest.

Tesla chair denies plans to look for new CEO to replace Musk,"(Reuters) -Tesla chair Robyn Denholm on Thursday denied a Wall Street Journal report that said board members had reached out to executive search firms to find a new replacement for CEO Elon Musk. The Journal had reported on Wednesday Tesla's board members had reached out about a month ago to several executive search firms to find a new CEO, citing people familiar with the discussions. Denholm called the report ""absolutely false"" and said on X the EV maker's board is ""highly confident"" in Musk's ability to ""continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead"". Musk said on X the report was a ""deliberately false article"". Activist investors have long accused Tesla's board of lacking independence and failing to rein in Musk. Tesla is at a crucial juncture. Musk has pivoted from his promise of making a new affordable EV platform to rolling out driverless taxis and humanoid robots, highlighting Tesla's future as an AI and robotics company instead of an automaker. However, shares have been sliding for months, as its EV sales have slumped in the U.S. and Europe in a backlash to his embrace of far-right politics and as competitors have started to take up market share with newer models. Musk's role in the Trump administration overseeing efforts to cut federal jobs has resulted in a considerable resentment in the U.S. His work at the Department of Government Efficiency has been one of the most controversial aspects of the Trump presidency, and his time away from Tesla has been an added concern for investors as sales of its aging EV lineup have been declining. Musk said last week he would cut back significantly on the time he devotes to the Trump administration and spend more time running Tesla. But his political shift has led to protests against Musk and the company, as well as vandalism at its showrooms and charging stations in the U.S. and Europe. Shares of Tesla were up marginally in Thursday premarket action. The company's sales plunged again in France and Denmark in April, dropping 59% and 67%, respectively, from a year ago. The board members met Musk and asked him to acknowledge publicly that he would spend more time at Tesla, the WSJ report said. It was unclear if Musk - also a board member - was aware of succession planning, or if his pledge to spend more time at Tesla has affected the efforts, the report said. Much of the company's valuation is based on that vision and some investors say Trump will help further it. Last week, federal regulators eased rules for testing autonomous vehicles, boosting Tesla's stock. Some Tesla directors, including co-founder JB Straubel, have been meeting with major investors to reassure them the company is in good hands, the WSJ said. Denholm, hand-picked by Musk whose controversial pay package she defended, has also drawn criticism for her own pay package along with questions on whether that compromised her oversight of Tesla and Musk. Denholm has dismissed the allegations and a spokesperson has said her pay was fair. In March, Denholm sold about $33.7 million worth of electric automaker's stock, according to a regulatory filing. The eight-person Tesla board, which includes Musk's brother Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has been looking to add an independent director, the report said.

Just like Amazon was never gonna breakout their pricing to show the tariffs...I highly doubt an outlet like WSJ didn't do their due diligence.

Are you interested by European Stock Market ?,"Hi everyone !! I know were going through a tough market moment. Im French, and as a Frenchman, I have access to stock portfolios with tax advantages. We benefit from a kind of liquidity basket where you can buy and sell European stocks without being taxed, as long as nothing leaves the basket (otherwise, capital gains tax applies, though its reduced after 5 years). You can even invest in US index ETFs within it.When investing in the US, Ive started to balance my US ETFs with European stocks. The observation is clear: my European stocks have clearly outperformed my US ones. When I read their financial reports and business updates, its extremely positive, and unlike before, theyre being rewarded with rising stock prices. Thats not all : while large-cap stocks also suffered from the April 7 dip, my European small-caps held up incredibly well and continued to rise.I know people tend to overlook Europe and focus mainly on US markets. But I think the European market is currently offering a real investment opportunity: * Huge investments from the EU and member states. Notable examples include Germanys 1 trillion plan, Frances 150 billion plan for data centers, the European rearmament plan, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which heavily benefits Italy (750 billion). * Companies are no longer afraid to expand beyond Europe. Legrand is a leader in data centers and has a strong presence in the US, as does Schneider Electric. SAP is ready to take on the likes of ServiceNow. We have true multinationals with strong growth potential. * Banking sector : very good economic situation for them, * Small-caps are following suit and standing out, some even securing major US clients like Tesla. Id love to know if anyone is interested in European stocks, or if youre solely focused on the US.A little plug: Ive started a Twitter account (@Ricky\_Macchiato) to talk about the European and US stocks Im targeting, share my ideas, etc. (No investment advice).

The dollar index fell below 98 and its lowest since March 2022. Trump was pushing for immediate rate cut. In fact, the stock market wants that too, but Trump took next step and he think that might fire Powell. Unbelievable. Still, analysts are not expecting a rate cut in May. The stock market dropped more than 2% and this marked the only red day of the week. Tuesday: After Monday's 2% drop, Tuesday started strong with around 1%. Trump said ""I have no intention of firing him"" referring to Powell also there was renewed hope about tariff issues. However, we had heard about negative progress for Mexico, Japan and Vietnam. Despite this, the stock market had a positive day and closed up more than 2.5%. The 4-day losing streak broken. Wednesday: China signaled that they are open to talks about tariffs and the stock market liked it. At the opening, the stock market jumped more than 2%. The White House officially announced that tariffs on China will be reduced between 50% and 60%. Gold prices surged to $3,500, but then broke their 2-day streak and pulled back to around $3,300. The stock market closed higher more than 1.5%. Thursday: The stock market opened neutral after 2-day winning streak. China expressed that they want all tariffs to be removed from U.S. Big tech companies will release their Q1 earnings and starting with Google on Thursday after the market closed. Google reported strong results and announced $70 billion buyback plans. Meanwhile, China announced no trade talks with U.S. yet. The stock market closed higher over 2% and extending its wining streak to 3-day. Friday: The stock market opened neutral again. China's Foreign Ministry said that there are no ongoing tariff consultations with the U.S. On the other hand, Google's strong results continued to hope for investors. Later in the day, China was considering increasing tariffs on the some U.S. goods to 125%. Trump announced that a deal with Japan is very close. Also, he spoke with China Xi's about tariffs. Trump said that U.S. won't drop any tariffs unless China give to something. We heard a lot of announcement. The stock market closed higher again and marking 4-day winning streak. It seems Powell issue was resolved on Monday because we haven't heard any updates. If an agreement is announce with Japan, it would be very positive sign for tariff progress. Overall, this week was pretty good. The S&P 500 hit 6,147 on February 19 and we're still about 10% below. The 50-day moving average was at 5,635 for yesterday. We could reach that level since March 3. If we can close above it that could be a good sign for rally to continue. What do you think?

Why Isn't the Market Lower?,"It seems to me that the stock market is factoring in a full (or almost full) repeal of Trump's tarrifs. What I see is a president who loves tariffs, who loves reneging on trade deals (even ones he's made), loves being in the spotlight, and loves thinking/knowing that he's the one who's pulling the strings. I can't imagine Trump just relinquishing this power of chaos over the markets. I'm expecting months if not years more of this... With 10% tarrifs across the board, we're looking at some mix of lowered corporate profits and/or inflation mixed with a decrease in GDP. But the market is acting like Elon going back to Tesla and Trump not firing someone he couldn't fire anyway (and will likely replace next year), as reasons to pump and pump. What am I missing? Is the market simply calling Trump's bluff, thinking/knowing that he won't allow a dip more than X%? I'm personally not pumping more in the market right now because I believe it's a fools' pump.

Tesla stock rises after-hours trading despite earnings miss,"How does this even make sense? I get it. Markets are irrational. But this is nuts.

Interesting Stocks Today (04/22) - Solar Powered Tariffs!,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. Sorry for not posting yesterday, I was being attacked by gorillas. Despite the loss of my kidneys/hands/eyes/nose, the watchlist will continue. News: [Trump's Trade War Puts Us Dollar Bonds Safe Haven Status At Risk]( [**TSLA (Tesla)**]( \- Tesla is set to report Q1 2025 earnings today after market close. Analysts anticipate EPS of $0.41 and revenue of $21.54B, reflecting a 13% YoY decline in deliveries to \~337K units. TSLA faces challenges from declining EV sales, brand damage, and potential impacts from new auto tariffs. I'm mainly interested in sub-$200 buys as a small reversal trade, not sure if I'll take a short position prior to earnings. Not interested in trading if the earnings are good. Risks include continued decline in deliveries, margin compression, and potential regulatory impacts from tariffs. Something else I'm interested in listening for is lessened political risk- if Elon is announcing an actual step down from DOGE then that might help the stock. [**SEDG (SolarEdge)**]( / [**FSLR (First Solar)**]( \- The U.S. has finalized tariffs up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, targeting countries like Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Most of our solar capability is imported from SE Asian countries. This move is meant to protect domestic manufacturers like SEDG and FSLR. Not too interested in this as a day trade, more as a swing trade. [**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**]( \- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties. [**JKS (JinkoSolar)**]( \- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.

Barron's: Stocks End Sharply Lower. The Dow Is on Pace for Worst April Since 1932.,"5 hours ago # Stocks End Sharply Lower. The Dow Is on Pace for Worst April Since 1932. By Connor Smith Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 972 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 dropped 2.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.6%. The indexes were even lower earlier in the session but retraced some ground. Still, the Dow is on track for its worst April since 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data. And the S&P 500 has fallen more than 1.5% for the sixth time this month, the most number of days since June 2022, when it also fell 1.5% six times. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Powell a major loser and criticized the central bank for keeping interest rates steady. His latest threats against Powell have some market observers worried Trump will seek to replace the central bank chair. If the independence of the Federal Reserve were to come into question, and especially if that concern were to materialize, it could further erode foreign investor confidence in U.S. dollar-denominated assets,"" writes Mike Goosay, chief investment officer and global head of fixed income at Principal Asset Management. Longer-dated bonds and the U.S. dollar continued to struggle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.4%, while the 30-year yield was up to 4.91%. ""The Vigilantes sent the President a clear message...'leave the Fed Chair Alone,'"" writes Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. ""Focus on your tariffs and Ukraine... 30 years were under pressure all day."" The U.S. Dollar Index fell to its lowest levels since 2022. As we look ahead, questions around the U.S.'s long-standing dominance in global security and trade frameworks are also starting to impact confidence and thats contributing to downward pressure on the U.S. dollar, writes Goosay. There's wasn't much in the way of economic data, so Trump's post and a lack of major updates on trade deals amid worries about tariffs dominated Wall Street's attention. That could change tomorrow when a wave of key earnings reports including Tesla's are due out. ""Management commentary this quarter matters more than the backward looking numbers,"" writes Rosenberg Research strategist Bhawana Chhabra. ""It has not been encouraging so far.""",StockMarket,2025-04-22,140,https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-042125/card/stocks-end-sharply-lower-the-dow-is-on-pace-for-worst-april-since-1932--H1f9JcPMBzJZaOl5E9y7,"I love all the creative ways they're coming up to say ""stock go down"".",
Markets Slump on Persistent Concern That Tariffs Will Hurt Growth,"Markets on Monday continued to reverberate from President Trumps trade war, with Japan stocks slumping, the U.S. dollar continuing to lose ground and oil prices slipping. U.S. stock markets, which reopen Monday after the Good Friday holiday, were pointing to a lower open. S&P 500 futures were nearly 1 percent lower. The Nikkei 225, Japans benchmark stock index, fell 1.2 percent in early trading. The Nikkei ended last week on an upswing on hopes of a trade deal with the United States. Elsewhere, Taiwans benchmark fell 1.4 percent, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.31 percent. Stocks in Japan and Taiwan, both of which are highly intertwined trading partners with the United States, are the worst performers this year in Asia. Oil futures, which have fallen as much as 24 percent since mid-January, were down about 1.5 percent on Monday, with Brent crude at about $67 a barrel. Oil prices are often considered a barometer of future economic growth, and they have been weighed down by the prospect that Trumps tariffs will damage international trade. The U.S. dollar continued its slide against Japanese yen on Monday, falling nearly 1 percent, the lowest since September. Against the euro, the dollar fell about as much, to the lowest in more than three years. We believe dollar weakness will continue, said Win Thin, a managing director at Brown Brother Harriman, in a note. He noted though that recent gains in some currencies may not last because economic growth was likely to weaken. Many markets, including those in Hong Kong, Australia and much of Europe, remained closed on Monday for Easter holidays. Investors remain on edge over the global economy. Mr. Trump has drastically raised U.S. tariffs on imports, as high as 145 percent on Chinese goods, to flatten U.S. trade imbalances. Beyond tariffs, Washington has tightened trade on critical items such as advanced silicon chips. China has responded with high tariffs on U.S. goods and restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, essential for electric car motors and other technologies. Economists project these changes will raise prices while impeding growth. Trump administration officials have said many U.S. trading partners have sought to make deals to avoid suffocating tariffs, but no agreements have been announced. And it remains unclear if any talks are underway between Washington and Beijing to ease those sky-high tariffs. The coming week will provide updates on how companies are coping with the changes. Tesla will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and Alphabet and Intel on Thursday. Their forecasts will be scoured to pinpoint the projected impact of the new trade policies. And the International Monetary Fund has already warned that its latest projections for the global economy, to be released on Tuesday, will forecast slower growth and higher inflation this year than previously anticipated. Protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial market stress, Kristalina Georgieva, the I.M.F. managing director, said in a speech on Thursday. The decline of the dollar may be a reflection of that stress. On the surface, a weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper overseas, and imports more expensive. But a substantial shift could signal that investors are moving away from a decades-long belief that the dollar and U.S. assets were a safe haven, and are instead choosing to put their money elsewhere.",StockMarket,2025-04-21,62,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html?unlocked_article_code=1.BU8.wY99.xj_sqd-1X3tq&smid=re-share,I have no idea why stocks continue to be up in these levels.

Over 1000 NASDAQ Listed Companies Earning Calls Over Next Two Weeks - The Pain Train Accelerates?,"Looking at[ it appears there will be a massive amount of earnings calls happening over the next two weeks, including some heavy hitters like Tesla. For reference, this is a third of the companies on the NASDAQ. In the past we've seen earnings calls drastically whack a stock pretty hard if they're unexpectedly (or even expectedly) negative. So the question of the hour is how badly is this going to hurt? Some have said we are currently in a large dead cat bounce. Will this finally be the end of it?",StockMarket,2025-04-18,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1k29xcm/over_1000_nasdaq_listed_companies_earning_calls/,"I bet most will say they had a great first quarter and either not provide guidance or provide two scenarios for going forward.

I'm expecting a huge drop in earnings, but also expecting them to cook the books.Due to negative consumer sentiment projecting a spending decrease in Q1 and the FED revising down forecasts for 2025, I expect Q1 numbers to reflect that and we will see a subsequent sell off. I could absolutely be wrong with wall street expecting bad numbers and and a moderately down to flat response, but a rally here would seem at odds with reality.I mean, that happens every quarter? There is always a few weeks where ALL companies report earnings?",
Forget tariffs. The real war is happening in the bond market.,"While everyone was watching headlines about chip exemptions and auto tariff pauses, the actual battlefront quietly shifted to something much more serious U.S. Treasuries. China has begun selling off U.S. government bonds, and this week the yield on the 10-year surged above 4.5%. Thats not just volatility its a red flag. For those unfamiliar: bond yields go up when demand drops. And the 10-year is the backbone of global risk pricing. Historically, when stocks drop, bonds rally theyre the safe haven. But not now. Stocks are falling. Bonds are falling. Thats not normal even Barclays titled their client note: This is not normal. Why it matters? 1. China is signaling its done playing nice. Selling Treasuries isnt just diversification its a geopolitical move. 2. If Europe joins the sell-off (and some signs suggest they might), this becomes more than a warning its a structural unraveling of confidence in U.S. fiscal stability. 3. Every long red candle you see? Thats not panic over tariffs or Teslas margins thats institutional capital quietly stepping off the table. Sure, the market bounced on Friday. But dont let that fool you these rebounds are like spasms in a body under shock. The fundamental shift is already underway. No tweet will stop it. Not even one from the king of tariffs himself. The U.S. cant keep applying band-aids with election-year PR while the world begins to hedge against the dollar and U.S. debt. So if youre wondering why good news isnt saving the market anymore its because the people who move this market have already left the room. Update: Yes the sell-off isnt typical. We saw a similar move back in 2018, when Russia sharply reduced its U.S. Treasury holdings it was visible in the TIC reports with a sudden $80B drop. They used custodial accounts in Belgium, masking direct attribution at first. Now we see similar behavior: yields are rising fast without major domestic triggers, and China just halted rare earth exports a clear geopolitical signal. Add to that the drop in FX reserves and quiet USD accumulation by the PBoC this points to China likely selling Treasuries. This isnt just technical foreign exit is real, and its strategic.",StockMarket,2025-04-15,5871,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jzifew/forget_tariffs_the_real_war_is_happening_in_the/,"If everyone is selling, and the US government needs to increase the debt ceiling ...what happens?If Trump is the catalyst to the US losing its status as world reserve currency, it's the biggest act of domestic economic terrorism in the history of mankind.

So what got us here?,"On March 8th the President of the United States looking more like a car salesman than any car salesman has ever looked, hawked Teslas on the front lawn. On March 16th Howard Lutnick, our illustrious commerce secretary, stated that ""Tesla would never be this cheap"", oh yeah, he owns Tesla but no worries. On April 19th Trump tweeted that [THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,]( Um, his fund owns DJT, like a lot of DJT. Okay so back to the question of what got us to the brink of a bear market and the strong possibility of a prolonged recession being priced into the market in matter of weeks . Yes of course it was the dumb as rocks Tariff's and the attack on China, which by the way only hurt the poor and middle class, because the jobs are gone and not coming back, and all the trade war does is raise prices to consumers, and the 1% will ride it out make bank on the back end. But that will play out over time. What brings us to what some consider our current crisis in confidence in the stock market? I think it is because the founders of the Constitution never considered that a sitting president would ever use the presidential pardon on himself. I mean Lutnick and MTG and their ilk know they are going to be pardoned and it's open season, but to know you can do Anything and get away with it, can you imagine, I mean the stock market is nothing but a toy for the child man to play with.

People are talking as if Trump was the problem , and that we just have to ""stop him"". The issue is that He is not the problem, he is the symptom. The problem is that the republican institutions that held the checks and balances which prevented a single point of critical failure in our government system have been hollowed out and made your country prime for any grifter to take advantage of the rot. If it was not Trump, it would have been someone else. Who's fault is it? Elected officials in general doing ""politics as usual"" over the last 30+ years are to blame for this.An apathetic public also has a share of the blame on this. The time for alarm was back when politicians started the War on drugs, the Crime Bill, the impunity around the Iran-Contras scandal, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the Patriot Act, Guantanamo, the normalization of torture, the warrantless spying, the broad usage of civil asset forfeiture, the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses and without a formal declaration of war from Congress, the Wall Street bail outs and the impunity due to ""too big to fail/too big to jail"", the prosecution of whistle blowers on warrantless spying and war crimes, the passing of the ""Hague Invasion Act"" to protect American war criminals... Someone like Donald Trump is just where this road ultimately leads to.The founding father's assumed the public would threaten the rest of the government into line to not allow this sort of corruption. They definitely never considered that a political party would purposely obstruct checks and balances, and they never ever assumed the public would tolerate that at all.The founding fathers were honorable men. The current occupants of the WH are not. The founders never envisioned corruption at this level.There were a lot of dominos to fall - Ronald Reagan doing away with the fairness act allowing right-wing radio to blossom, the moral majority, Newt Gingrich, Fox News, Bill Clinton, W, the Trump unleashing an unholy hell of madness and meanness and the GOP aiding and abetting him. I thought he would only affect our norms and mores, but now he seems hellbent on using his ignorance to destroy the national and world economy.",
Trump tariffs: Elon Musk calls Peter Navarro dumber than a sack of bricks,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans.

Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car ""assembler"" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas.",StockMarket,2025-04-08,1569,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1juj3su/trump_tariffs_elon_musk_calls_peter_navarro/,"First lesson for Elon Musk... Work with evil and expect the evil to turn on you once they are done using you. There is no honor among thieves.Meanwhile my MAGA family is still 3 weeks behind going wild for Musk on FacebookWe were all taking bets when the relationship between Trump and Elon would sour. The answer is two months.That means all Auto Manufacturers are actually just Auto Assemblers. But this administration is telling Muricans they are bringing back Manufacturing. Got blindsided again I see.The problem for Trump here is that even before the tariffs were officially announced, China has gone into high gear preparing for them and taking pre-emptive measures throughout their vast centrally controlled economy and its web of partnerships throughout the world. Unlike the US with thousands of large corporations with a wide array of different strategies and risk tolerances to this uncertainty, China has the advantage of direct control, which gives it unprecedented ability in the modern age to orchestrate any shifts in planning and absorb any fallout since its pieces are part of the whole -- if one sector is hit particularly hard, the central government can control for that and safeguard the industry until the changes allow it to recover. As US companies scramble and flail for any traction here, China has unyielding resolve in part because it has been preparing for the worst for six months since Trump's election. And six months in China's economy is a lot longer comparatively than six months in the US economy due to the efficiency of central planning -- whatever we may think otherwise about its drawbacks. And with the soft power and economic advantage they have built carefully through its global multi-trillion dollar Belt and Road initiative, they have an agile global trade network with developing countries whose economies are growing quickly, in large part due to the economic aid from China -- again, however usurious the lending may be to leverage their advantage, it's looking like quite the smart bet right now. And, of course, Trump has pushed the rest of the advanced world -- EU, Japan, Canada -- away from the US and, with little other option -- closer to China. To mitigate the trade repercussions, China also has the advantage of its incredible direct state spending on massive infrastructure developments, which they can ramp up even further to support the economy and bridge the gap while trade adjusts. They build bridges and dams and thousands of miles of railroads in a fraction of the time the US does -- by the time a project here nears the end of the planning stage, China has built a bigger one and moved onto the next, and for far less money -- whether in China itself or overseas across the Belt and Road to support Chinese interests. Despite all this, Trump still insists that he is holding all the cards. He keeps raising, and China keeps calling. He thinks he has Xi Jinping beat, and appears willing to throw our stack of chips in the pot to prove it. I don't have a lot of confidence in the result when the betting's over and they show their cards.",

He's actually the most damaging bit about Tesla right now.>Tesla **became** a political target this year as demonstrators targeted their criticism of Musk and DOGE on the company, protesting at showrooms or charging stations across the country. The media just can't help themselves. Tesla jumped into politics...none of us put them there. The company, board, and shareholders are all apparently super thrilled with their CEO heading an illegal scheme within the executive branch wherein unelected/unconfirmed individuals steal congressionally approved funding.I love how he blames his DOGE work for the stock getting destroyed. Yes Elon, the reason sales are down 70% in Europe is because youre destroying the US government Hes desperate for people to forget hes as far right wing as someone could possibly be.Alienating ur customer base is never good for business. Damage done. Just going to get worse every quarter.",
